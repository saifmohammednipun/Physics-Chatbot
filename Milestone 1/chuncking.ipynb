It is inextricably related to each and every \\nactivities of our daily life .Starting from the toothpaste used in the morning to the day long using \\nof internet, mobile and watching of television all are the fruits of scientific discovery. Science \\nhas made human life beautiful and prosperous. It has increased comfort and happiness. However, this development of science was not possible in a day. Science has reached this stage due to \\nuntiring efforts of innumerable scientist from ancient time. In this chapter we will try to \\nintroduce the contribution of those dedicated scientists by giving a description of a brief but continuous history of development of physical science especially of physics from ancient times. \\nMeasurement is related to most of our daily activ ities.

The main \\nobjectives of physics are to establish the relation between matter and energy and to \\nexpress it quantitatively on the basis of obser vation, experimentation and analysis.  \\nScope of Physics :  \\nPhysics is the key of all science. It is the fundamental branch of science because the \\nfoundation of other subjects is based on the principles of physics. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a basic principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Starting from Engineering to Medical Science, Astronomy to Oceanology, Biology to \\nPsychology the instruments of Physics are used.   \\nFor the systematic study of physics, we can divide it into the following branches : (1) \\nMechanics (2) Heat and thermodynamics (3) Sound (4) Optics (5) Electricity and Magnetism (6) Solid State Physics (7) Atomic  Physics (8) Nuclear Physics (9) Quantum \\nPhysics and (10) Electronics  \\nDevelopment of physics:    \\nModern civilization is the product of science. Behind this development of science there \\nare untiring efforts, discoveries and innovation of scientists. Science has no national or political boundaries. The growth, development and benefit of science are enjoyed by all people of all nations. From ancient time scientist have been contributing for the development of science. In this lesson we will try to mention the contributions of physicists. Thales (624-569 B.C) is famous for his predictions regarding solar eclipse. He also knew about the magnetic properties of loadstone. Pythagoras (527-497 B.C) is a memorable name in the history of science. Beside the invention of several Geometric \\ntheorem, he made longer lasting contribution through his works on vibrating string. He was given several Geometric theorem .More over, he made long lasting contributions \\nthrough his works on vibrating strings. The pr esent scales of musical instruments and \\nmusic are partially the contributions of his research on the vibration of strings.  \\nGreek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C) gave the idea that the matter consists of \\nindivisible units. He called it atom. His c oncept about atom was significant even though \\nit is completely different from the present concept. Greek scientist Archimedes (287-212 B.C) discovered  the principles of lever and the law of upward force acting on bodies immersed in liquid and was able to determine the impurity in metals. He also knew the \\ntechnique of setting fire by concentrating sun rays with the help of spherical mirrors.  \\nAfter Archimedes, scientific discoveries advanced rather slowly for a few centuries. In \\nfact scientific discoveries did not revive in Europe before the thirteenth century. During '),\n",

The Arabs were also particularly advanced in Science, Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry and Medical Science. During this time the contribution of Ibne-Al-Haith an (965-1039 A.D) and Al-Hazen (965-1038 \\nA.D) may be particularly mentioned for their theories of light, a branch of physics. Ptolemy (127-151 A.D) and other earlier scientists believed that the eyes itself sends light rays to see an object. Al-Hazen contradicted this view and asserted that we see an object because light rays from the object fall on our eyes. Experiments with magnifying glass brought him near to the modern theory of convex lens. Al-Masudi (896-956 A.D) wrote an encyclopedia on the History of Nature in which the name of Windmill was first mentioned. At present many countries of the world produce electricity by using this \\nwindmill.  \\nRoger Bacon (1214-1294 A.D) was the pioneer of the experimental scientific methods. \\nAccording to him all scientific truths should be verified through observations and experiments. At the end of the fifteenth century, Leonardo de Vinci (1452-1519 A.D) made a model of aero plane by observing the act of flying of birds. Although he was a painter, he had considerable knowledge about mechanics. As a result, he was able to invent efficiently some common instruments. During the Galileo-Newtonian age and even before that time a few of very important scientists, although small in number were born. They contributed a lot to the advancement of science too. Dr. Gilbert (1540-1603 A.D) is unforgettable for his extensive research and theory on magnetism. Snell (1591-1626 A.D) of Germany discovered the laws of refraction of light. Huygen (1626-1695 A.D) reviewed the motion of pendulum, developed the mechanical device of clocks and invented the wave theory of light. Robert Hook (1635-1703 A.D) strove to find out the elastic properties of bodies. Robert Boyle (1627-1691 A.D) conducted experiments to find out the properties of gases at differ ent pressures. Von Guerick (1602-1686 A.D) \\ninvented air pump. Romer (1644-1710 A.D) measured the velocity of light by studying the eclipse of a satellite of Jupiter, but none of his contemporary scientist believed that \\nvelocity of light could be so high.  \\nKepler (1571-1630 A.D) presented three laws for a general mathematical explanation of \\nconcept of solar-centered theory of Copernicus. Kepler’s success was based on his assumption of an elliptical orbit opposed to the conventional circular orbit. He verified the validity of his mathematical laws about the orbits of the planets with the data \\ncollected through observation by his teacher Tychobrahe (1546-1601 A.D).  \\nThe inception of modern scientific method was made by a famous Italian scientist \\nGalileo (1564-1642 A.D). He showed for the first time that the observations, \\nexperimentations and definitions of physical quantities systematically and the '),\n",

Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he di scovered the laws of falling bodies and \\nestablished the foundation of statics. Ne wton by his versatile genius discovered \\nmechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of \\nmathematics.  \\nThe discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for  \\nEurope to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791-1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the \\nprocess of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.  \\nIn 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of \\nelectromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiati on was also discovered and produced in 1888 \\nby Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through ″Morse code ″ to far \\noff distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Cha ndra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send \\nenergy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of \\nuranium.  \\nIn the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max \\nPlanck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879-1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity.  These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford’s (1871-1937 A. D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill \\nBohr’s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very \\nimportant step of atomic physics.  \\nThe next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 \\nA.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom '),\n",

The amount of energy we are getting at present \\nfrom the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck’s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein’s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926-1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of me dical science in twentieth century. By using \\nradio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the \\nMars.   \\nArtificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. \\nMoreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have \\ndeveloped human’s work ability to a great extent.   \\nIn nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. \\nOutstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another \\nadvancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.  \\n1.2 Objectives of Physics :  \\nPhysics unearths the mystery of nature:  Physics is the fundamental branch of science \\nbecause its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide \\nrange of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting.  \\nAlthough the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective \\nof physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature. In the beginning of twentieth century physicist discovered that electrons revolves around '),\n",

Subsequent experiments proved that nucleus \\nconsists of protons and neutrons. Now the physicists have discovered that proton and \\nneutron are formed of more smaller particles.  \\nThe study of physics helps not only to understand and explain the natural events but also \\nits application plays a vital role in other branch es of science. At present physics is at the \\ncentre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope \\nwhich has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology.      \\nIn physics there is development of theories and application mathematics at the same time \\nit has practical application and engineering application too. Physics is very essential to \\ngive fundamental explanation and form idea about Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology etc. In addition, there is wide application of methodology and instruments \\nof physics in Biology, Oceanology, Psychology and Medical Science.  \\nPhysics describes the laws of nature : The natural world that we live in follows some \\ncertain laws e.g. Newton’s law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since \\nour childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature \\nbut can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about \\nthem. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation.   \\nDevelopment of technology results from the proper application of fundamental \\nlaws of physics :  \\nWe have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how \\ntelevision works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth,  , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using \\ninternet the whole world can be explored in a moment . The discovered laws of physics \\npave the way to invent these technologies.  \\nStudy of physics is a perfect human training    : \\nWe can achieve new idea by the study of physics. Physics instructs on how to think, \\nshow cause, how to put argument, how to utili ze logic and mathematics. It stimulates our \\nimagination and develops the power of thinking.  \\nPhysics teaches how to carry out observation:   \\nWe can develop our capability of observation. We can also learn how to carry out \\nsystematic observations by studying physics properly '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/saifmohammed/Desktop/Physics-Chatbot/Text Book/Physics Classes 9-10 (English Version) - National Curriculum and Textbook Board of Bangladesh - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='Physics  7 \\n1.3 Space and time  \\nIn science particularly in physics the concept of space and time is very important. We \\nneed the concept of space and time to describe any event, because without it we cannot get clear idea about space and time of the event. The concept of space is in vogue from ancient time to locate the position of an object and space occupied by it. Similarly the \\nconcept of time is necessary to understand sequence and duration of the event.  \\nEuclid’s concept:  Euclid was fast to present the geometric concept of space.  \\nGalileo’s concept: Galileo in his book, Statics  used space and time in the law of motion \\nand acceleration. Thus space and time have become very important quantities in \\nmathematical equations.  \\nNewton’s concept: The concept of space and time has become more clear and taken \\nquantitative form through Newtonian mechanics. Space is a three dimensional extension in Newtonian or classical physics. Space has no beginning or end. It has limitless extension. Space can be divided into infinite small parts i.e. space is continuous. Space is homogenous as regions of any space are identical. Space is independent. Though all the events take place and spread within the space; space is never influenced by any object or \\nevent. Like space, time is also independent. So, passage of time cannot change space.    \\n1.4 Physical Quantities  \\nAny thing that is measurable in this physical world is called a physical quantity. For \\nexample, the length of a table can be measured. Here, length is a physical quantity. The mass of your body can be measured, mass is a physical quantity. The time during which you are reading this book can be measured, time is a physical quantity. If you apply force to lift some thing, that force can be measured. So force is a physical quantity. There are many such quantities in this physical world. Among these, it is seen that there are a few quantities which can be measured without any help from any other quantities. These quantities are `fundamental quantities’. For instance, to measure the length of a table, you need to measure only the length. To measure this length, there is no need of measuring any other quantity. So, length is a fundamental quantity. On the other hand, measurement of some quantities need the help of other quantities. For example, to measure the density of copper bar it is necessary to measure the mass and volume of a piece of copper bar and then mass is to be divided by the volume. Again, to measure the volume, the length, the breadth and the height are to be measured, that is, lengths are to be measured three times in three directions. So, it is seen that, there are certain quantities \\nwhich are fundamental. They do not depend on other quantities. These are called \\nfundamental quantities.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/saifmohammed/Desktop/Physics-Chatbot/Text Book/Physics Classes 9-10 (English Version) - National Curriculum and Textbook Board of Bangladesh - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='8  Physics \\nSo, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend \\non other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement. These are (1) length (2) mass (3) time (4) temperature (5) electric current (6) luminous intensity and (7) amount of \\nsubstance.  \\n All other quantities may be derived from fundamental quantities that means, these are \\nobtained from the product or quotient of one or more fundamental quantities. These are \\ncalled derived quantities or compound quantities.  \\nSo, the quantities depend on fundamental quantities or obtain from fundamental \\nquantities are called derived quantities. Velocity , acceleration, force, work, heat, electric \\ncurrent etc. are derived quantities since these are obtain from fundamental quantities.       \\nFor instance,  force = mass  x   acceleration \\n \\n velocity   \\n      velocity    \\n]  \\ntime  time   \\n \\n distance  \\n 1  \\n distance   \\n] time time time \\n \\n distance    \\ntime2    \\nHence, force is a derived quantity.  \\n1.5 Units of measurements \\nMeasurement is related to most of our daily activities. Moreover, we need accurate \\nmeasurement for various research works. The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu’s home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school’s office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure \\nanything. One is number and another is unit.  \\nA standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard \\nquantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter’s unit. There are different = mass ×\\n \\n= mass ×  \\n= mass ×  × [       acceleration =  \\n[      velocity =  '),\n",

Except some units all these \\nunits are interrelated with one another.  \\nFundamental unit in SI  \\nWe can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental \\nquantities do not depend on other units. But our selection must have international \\nrecognition. It should have some characteristics as well. For example, it should be unchangeable, that is, independent of place, time and person. It will not change due to \\npassage of time or any other natural change. It could be reproduced easily. The standard \\nof fundamental units that were accepted in 1960, while introducing the SI system of units, were changed later on in some cases in order to attain suitable characteristics. But \\nno change was brought in values of the units. For example, at present, meter is defined in \\nterms of distance traveled by light. Earlier, meter was defined using wavelength of a kind of light. Prior to it, the length of a rod kept at Sevres near Paris in France was taken \\nas the standard of meter.

The diameter of this cylinder is 3.9 cm ; its height is also 3.9 cm.  \\nUnit of time : Second : The time required to complete 9 192 631 770 vibrations by a \\ncaesium-133 atom is called one second (s).  \\nUnit of temperature : Kelvin : The temperature which equals to 1\\n273.16 of the \\nthermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water is called one Kelvin (k).  \\nUnit of electric current : Ampere : The ampere is that current which produces a force \\nof 2x10-7 Newton per meter in vacuum between two parallel infinitely long conductors \\nof negligible cross-sectional area 1 meter apart when each conductor carries the same current.  \\nUnit of luminous intensity: Candela : Candela   is the  quantity of luminous intensity of \\nany source of light which radiates monochromatic radiation at a particular direction with \\na frequency of 540x10\\n12 Hz and emissive power of 1\\n683 watt per steredian solid angle. second is defined as one meter (m).

So it is seen that the original number is \\nobtained from a number expressed in notation by placing the decimal point to the right by the number of digits equal to the power of 10 if the power is positive and to the left if \\nthe power is negative.  \\nIn the case of numbers expressed in scientific notation the following general rule of \\nmultiplication is applicable :  \\n10\\nm x 10n = 10m+n  \\nHere, m and n may be any positive or negative number.

(The \\nequation to express the dimension of physical quantity is called the dimensional \\nequation). Third bracket [ ] is used to i ndicate dimensions in any quantity. As for \\nexample, the dimensional equation of force is [ F ] = [ MLT-2 ]  \\nExcept these above mentioned three physical quantities of length, mass and time others \\ndimension of physical quantities are :  \\nThe dimension of temperature as θ (Capital alphabet of Greek letter θ), the dimension of \\nelectric current as I, the dimension of luminous intensity as J and the dimension of \\namount of substance as N.  \\nWe can verify the validity of any equation or formula by analyzing dimension. For \\nexample, the following equation may be considered:  \\n                  S = ut + 1\\n2  at2 \\nWe know that addition, subtraction or equiva lence are possible for any same kind of \\nquantities. Hence every term of an equation must indicate the same kind of quantity, that is, the dimension of every term must be the same. Now there are three terms in the above \\nequation, one to the left and two to the right.  \\nIn this equation, s is displacement : its dimension is L, u is initial velocity; its dimension \\nis \\nL/T = LT-1 , a is acceleration ; its dimension is L/T2 = LT-2 , t is time ; its dimension is T.  \\n∴The dimension is ut = LT-1 x T = L  \\n    The dimension of at2 = LT-2 x T2 = L   \\nThus it is seen that the dimension of each of the term on both sides of the above equation \\nis the same L. Therefore, the equation is valid.  \\n1.7 Scientific symbols and notations :  \\nMathematics is said to be the language of physics. We usually express the laws of \\nphysics in the form of mathematical equation and physicists solved many problems by applying these laws or equations. Various symbols and notations are used according to the SI system for different quantities and units. This SI system of units is not only used \\nin physics but also used in other branches of science now a days for measurement.  \\nThe following methods are followed for expressing symbol of units of different \\nquantities.  \\n1. The symbol of units are to be expressed by writing a number and a space after it \\n(actually expresses multiplication) for expressing the value of a quality. For example “2.21 Kg’’, “7.3 x 10\\n2 m2’’, “22 k’’. The sign of % also follows the same rule. However '),\n",

Derived unit produced by multiplication is expressed using a space between two units \\ne.g. N m.  \\n3. Derived unit produced by division is expressed as negative power e.g. meter/second is \\nexpressed as ms-1   .  \\n4. No punctuation mark or full stop is used with the notations as – they are not the abbreviated from any thing but the form of mathematical expression.  \\n5. The symbol of unit is written in Roman type font, for example m for meter, s for \\nsecond but the symbol of quantities are written in italic type font, for example, m for mass, s for displacement etc. It does not matte r what kind of language or font is used \\nafter of before of these symbols and units to express.  \\n6. The symbols of unit are expressed in small letters, for example “m’’, “s’’, “mol’’, but \\ncapital letters are used to write the unit which is derived from name of a person, for example, the unit N is derived from the name of Newton and Pa from Pascal. However, \\nwhile expressing full form of unit small letters are used. For example, newton or pascal.  \\n7. As prefix of a unit is the part of it, no space is used to express its symbol. For \\nexample, km for kilometer (k), MW for megawatt (M) GHz for giga Hertz (G). More \\nthan one prefix is not allowed to use such as µµF, but pF.  \\n8. Prefixes more than kilo (10\\n3) must be in capital letter.  \\n9. The symbols of units are always singular. Such as ``25 kg’’ instead of ``25 kgs’’.  \\n10. Line-break should be avoided for expressing any number or compound unit or \\nnumber and unit. Only for important purposes line-break may be acceptable.  \\n1.8 Measuring Instruments :  Meter Scale :   \\nThis simplest instrument to measure length in the laboratory is a meter scale. It’s length \\nis 1 meter or 100 centimeters. This is why, it is called a meter scale. One side of this \\nscale is graduated in centimeter and the other side in inches. Each centimeter is divided \\ninto ten equal parts. Each of this parts is called 1 millimeter or 0.1 centimeter. Each inch \\nis divided into eight, ten or sixteen equal parts.  \\nMeasure with a meter scale : To measure the length of a rod or a stick by the meter \\nscale, it’s one end is so placed that is coincides with the 0 mark or some other convenient mark of the scale. The reading of the mark that coincides with the other end of the rod is taken. The difference between the readings at the two ends of the rod gives '),\n",

In general if the reading of the mark that coincides with the left end \\nof the rod is x and that of the mark coinciding with the right end is y. Then the length of the rod is L = y – x. With this scale length may be measured to an accuracy of 1 \\nmillimeter. For more accurate measurement vernier scales are used.  \\nVernier scale :  \\nIn the ordinary meter scale we can measured length up to 1 millimeter. To measure \\nfractions of millimeter like 0.2mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm etc. we have to use vernier scale. This scale was invented by a mathematician Pierea Vernier and is called vernier scale \\naccording to his name.  \\n \\nFig.1.1 Vernier Scale  \\nA small scale is used by the side of the main scale for accurate measurement of fractions \\nof the smallest division of the main scale. By using vernier scale along with meter scale \\nfractions of millimeter may be measured accurately.  \\nVernier scale can be moved forward or backward along the side of the main scale. Say, a \\nvernier scale has ten divisions, this ten division is equal to nine smallest divisions of the \\nmain scale (fig 1.1). Nine smallest divisions  of main scale is 9 millimeter or 0.9 \\ncentimeter. As 10 vernier scale divisions is e qual to nine smallest divisions of the main \\nscale. So, a vernier scale division is slightly  smaller than the smallest division of the \\nmain scale. The difference between the smalle st main scale division and the vernier scale \\ndivision is called vernier constant. It is generally written by VC. A simple equation may be used to determine the vernier constant, that is vernier constant = s/n, where s is the \\nlength of 1 smallest division of the main scale and n the number of vernier divisions.  \\nAs mentioned above, s = 1 mm and n = 10 divisions  \\n∴ Vernier constant = s / n = 1mm / 10 = 0.1mm = 0.01cm.  \\nSometimes 20 vernier scale divisions are equal to 19 smallest main scale divisions and \\nthe smallest main scale division is less than 1mm. Then the vernier constant becomes difference. The vernier constant depends on the characteristics of marking the main scale \\nand the vernier scale.  \\n \\n '),\n",

Because the Venire’s method is used \\nfor the measurement with this instrument. The main scale of the slide calipers is made of \\na graduated rectangular still plate. A metal jaw is fixed at the starting end of the main scale, that is, at the end marked 0 of the ma in scale. A Jawed small scale is put over the \\nbody of the main scale, to measure fracti on of the small division of the main scale \\naccurately. It is called venire scale.  \\n \\nFig 1.2 Slide Calipers  \\nThis Jawed vernier scale can be moved forward or backward along with the main scale. \\nThere is screw in it. It can be fixed at any point on the body of the main scale with this screw. When the Jaw of the vernier scale touches the Jaw of the main scale then the zero \\nof the main scale should coincide with the zero of the vernier scale.  \\nBy using vernier scale fraction of millimeter may be measured accurately.  \\nVernier constant of the slide calipers can determine from the above mentioned vernier \\nscale chapter.  \\nMeasurement of slide calipers : Suppose, the length of rod is to be measured. The rod \\nis to be placed between the two jaws of th e slide calipers. The jaw connected with the \\nvernier scale is to be pushed forward so that  the jaws of the main scale and the vernier \\nscale touch the opposite ends of the object. Th e rod is placed such that it’s left end \\ncoincides with zero (0) mark of the main scale. The vernier scale is moved forward and backward to make it coincide with the right side of the rod. Suppose the right end of the rod has crossed M mm mark of the scale and is between M and (M + 1) mm. This extra \\ndistance beyond M mm is to be determined by using the vernier scale. This length will \\nbe the vernier reading.  \\nNow it is to be noted which vernier scale mark coincides with which of the main scale \\nmark. If no vernier mark coincide with a main scale mark then find out the nearest vernier mark. The reading of this mark that is the number of vernier scale divisions from \\nthe left to this mark, is the vernier scale reading.  \\nSuppose the V\\nth vernier mark coincides with or nearest with any main scale mark. Hence \\nthe vernier constant of the instrument is VC.  '),\n",

It \\nconsists of a u-shaped still frame F (1.3).  \\n \\nFig 1.3 Screw Gauge  \\nThe rod with plane end is permanently fixed with the plane surface A of one arm. The \\nother arm has a hollow cylinder C. A linear scale graduated in millimeter is marked on the cylinder and a screw with a cylindrical cap T is fitted with it. The screw can moved through the hollow cylinder C. The end of the cylindrical cap T is graduated 0 to 50 or 100. When the Jaws are closed, that is, then the head of the screw B touches the plane end of the fixed rod A, the zero of the circular scale coincides with the zero of the linear scale. If the zero marks of the two scales do not coincide, then there is instrumental \\nerror.  \\nThe distance through which the screw advances along the linear scale when the cap T is \\nrotated once is called the Pitch of the screw gauge. The distance through which the screw advances when the circular scale is rotated through only 1 division is called the least count. The least count is obtained by dividing the pitch by the number of divisions \\nin the circular scale.  Example :  Suppose, the end B of the rod has crossed 12mm mark of the main scale and 7th \\nvernier mark has coincide with a main scale mark. Then the length of the rod will be  L = 12mm + 7 x 0.1mm (here vernier constant is 0.1mm)  \\n   = 12.7mm = 1.27cm.   '),\n",

Then the diameter of the wire or the \\nthickness of the plate will be :  \\nDiameter or thickness = Linear scale reading + no. of divisions of the circular scale x \\nLeast count. \\n                    That is, D = L + C x LC   \\n     \\n \\nWhen the head of the screw touches the plane end of the fixed rod A, then the zero of the \\ncircular scale should coincide with the zero of  the linear scale, then it means there is an \\nerror. For this reading should be corrected.  \\nBalance :  \\nSometimes in physics and chemistry the mass of a small quantity of a substance needs to \\nbe measured very accurately, this is not possible with a common balance. The less quantity of the substance, the more accurate the balance should be. The balance is such an accurate weighting machine. This instru ment is used in physics and chemistry \\nlaboratories for accurate measurement of small masses. Because, if the measurement of the mass in the laboratory is not accurate, the result will be wrong and the objective of \\nthe experiment will not be fulfilled.  \\n     \\n \\nFig 1.4  Example : Suppose the linear scale is 3mm and the no. of divisions of the circular scale is 20, \\nthen the diameter of the wire = 3mm + 20 x 0.01mm = 3mm + 0.2mm = 3.2mm '),\n",

The scale pans are hanged from the ends of a metal beam AB with the help of two frames of equal weight. The frames are placed on two inverted knife edges \\nin two grooves at the end.  \\nA knife with its edges downward, is fixed in the middle of the beam AB. It is placed on a \\nhollow vertical pillar. The pillar is firmly fixed at the middle of a wooden floor CC. Three leveling screws LS are fixed with this floor (the third has not been shown in the \\nfig.). These are used to level the instrument. A solid metal rod inside the hollow pillar \\ncan be raised or lowered with the help of a level H connected with the floor. The base of triangular shaped agate is fixed exactly in the middle of the beam AB. The sharp age is \\nkept on an agate plate placed on the solid rod of the beam. When the solid rod is lifted, \\nthe beam AB swings about the narrow edge of the agate as the fulcrum.  \\nThe broad side of a long pointer (PO) is fixed at the middle of the balance. It’s lower \\nnarrow end is free to move over a scale. When the beam is horizontal, the pointed end of \\nthe pointer rests on the zero of the scale. The beam is made horizontal with the help of a \\nplumb-line (PL) and the leveling screws. The entire instrument is kept in a glass box.  \\nMeasurement by Balance : To use the balance, the handle H is rotated to left the pillar \\nand hence the beam AB .The beam will then start swing freely about the knife edge. \\nAlong with the beam the scale pans will also  keep in swinging up and down, with the \\nbackward rotation of the handle H. The pillar will be lowered and the swinging of the beam and scale pans will stop.  \\nWhen the beam AB swings, the lower end of the pointer keeps oscillating right and left \\nover the scale. If there is nothing on the scale pan, the oscillation of the pointer should be \\nequal on the two sides of the zero of the scale. If it is not, the two adjusted screws (BS) at the two ends of the beam AB are to be so adjusted that the oscillation of the pointer on \\nthe two sides of the zero of the scale becomes equal. Whether the pillar P is vertical or \\nnot is seen with the plumb-line PL.  \\nTo measure the mass of an object it is placed on the left-hand pan. Known weights are \\nplaced slowly on the right-hand pan one by one, till the pointer oscillates equally to the \\ntwo sides of the zero of the scale. Thus the ma ss of an object is determined with the help \\nof known weights.   \\nStopwatch  \\nStopwatch is used to measure small time in terval. Stopwatches are of two kinds digital \\nstopwatch and analog stopwatch. Digital stopwatch can give more accurate reading than that of analog stopwatch.

An error of about a \\nlarge fraction of a second takes place in the reading of time interval though it may vary \\nfrom person to person. The degree of error is more to the old than the young. For most of \\nthe people the error is about 0.3seconds.  \\n1.9 Error and accuracy in measurement   \\nAll measurements have some limitations of  accuracy. Accuracy of measurement depend \\non the skill of observer and the instruments used. Suppose a meter scale is graduated in centimeter and millimeter. If we want to meas ure the length of this book we will get the \\nresult probably up to 0.1cm accurately. In Accuracy may be reduced in case of \\nmeasuring the length of a house because the scale is to be used several time for measuring the full length. Every time the position of the front edge of the scale has to be \\nmarker on the floor. This increases the source of error thus increasing the probability of \\nerrors.  \\nThe accuracy of measurement is as important  as measurement itself. So, the observer \\nshould mention the degree of accuracy of result with the result of the experiment. Let the \\nlength of this book be 26.0cm ± 0.1cm. Here the symbol ± means that the real length of \\nthe book is between 25.9cm and 26.1cm. Here 0.1cm is the uncertainty or error of measurement.  \\nGenerally there are three types of error in measurement. There are :  a) Random error  \\nb) Instrumental error   c) Personal error  a) Random error : The error for which irrelevant occur in measured results by \\nmeasuring a constant quantities. Several times is random error. The word random itself \\nimplies that the error cannot be guessed earlier and expected value will be zero. This is because measured values moves around the accurate value and average value of the \\nerrors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. \\nThe random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the \\naccurate mark. Another random error takes place with the measurement when the meter \\nscale is placed at the previous marking (sli ghtly error position) as back edge starts from \\nback and forth position. The final result may be very much high or low due to random \\nerror. It is impossible to avoid random error but this error can be reduced by \\nprecautionary measurement. In order to minimize the random error average of the frequent measurement is to be taken.  \\nb) Instrumental error : We need instruments for experimental measurement in physics. \\nThe error with the instrument is called instrumental error. For example, if the zero \\nmarking of main scale is not super-imposition with the zero marking vernier then the result of measurement will not be accurate. This kind of error is known as instrumental '),\n",

Similarly if the indicator needle of  ammeter or voltmeter is not super-imposition \\nwith the zero marking then there remains error with the instrument. The instrumental \\nerror has to be determined before starting the experiment. Finally the actual reading has \\nto be obtained by subtracting this error from the reading.  \\nc) Personal error : We have to take various readings during experiment. The error that \\nan experimenter makes during experiment is called personal error. The error with the \\nposition of the observer, observing any mark or any calculation is also said to be \\npersonal error. For example there will be an error while measuring the length of a rod if the super-imposition of the edge of a rod with a definite mark of the scale is observed \\nobliquely instead of perpendicular position. There will be error in reading when we \\ncannot observe which division of circular s cale is in super-imposition with the linear \\nscale of a time per screw gauge. Similarly we cannot find accurate if there is mistake in \\ncounting oscillation number while determining time period of a pendulum. All these are \\nknown as personal errors. We have to take the reading properly and carefully with a view to avoiding these errors.  \\nInvestigation:1.1  Determination of area and volume of a rectangular substance.

In answer to  this question we will know the position \\nof your school. If you say your school is in Jheeltuli it is absolutely true but we cannot know the exact position of your school fro m this information. We can know the exact \\nposition only when you mention the position, direction and distance of your school with \\nrespect to a particulars place. At first we have to consider a known point or an object with respect to that the position of another point or object is to be determined. For \\nexample, if said your school is one kilometer apart in the east from the gate of your \\nresidence, its position can be told certainly. We have to consider a particular point to find out the position of our village or town, country or the world or the universe around \\nus. This point is called reference point or origin and fixed object with respect to which \\nwe find out the position, rest and motion of another object is known as reference frame. Any point can be considered as reference point for our convenience. In the above \\nexample we could consider any other point as reference point.  \\nRest and motion :  We see many object around us of them some are rest and some are in \\nmotion. What do we actually mean by rest and moving object.  \\n \\nWhat is there around the pen ? Does the position of the pen get changed with respect to \\nother objects around ? It does not. The pen in your has a particulars distance and \\ndirection with respect to the objects around you such as your chair, table, book, copy, house, door, window and to all other things. So  the position of your pen is fixed with \\nrespect to other objects around you. The position of the pen is not changing with the \\nchange of time. We can say the pen is in rest to the surroundings. The act of remain rest of the pen is called rest. Therefore, a body is said to be static or at rest with respect to its \\nsurroundings when it does not change its position with time.  \\nAni is standing by the side of the road. He said that, houses, plants and trees, electric \\npoles etc are standing at rest. Why does he say so ? According to Ani those objects are \\nnot changing their positions with respect to time.  \\n \\n \\nDoes the position of the pen change with  respect to the objects around, the position and \\ndirection of the pen is gradually changing with respects to each object of its surrounding. The position of the pen is changing with time. We say the pen is in motion with respect \\nto the surroundings. A body is said to be in motion with respect to its surroundings when \\nit changes its position with time. And this change of position with time is called motion.  \\nWe discussed earlier that to understand whether an object is in rest or in motion it is \\nnecessary to chose a reference object or reference frame. If the relative positions of this Do by yourself : Hold a pen in your hand . \\nDo by yourself : Keep the pen in your hand moving to and fro . '),\n",

If the considered object and \\nthe reference object move along the same direction with same velocity even though the \\ndistance between the objects, remain unchanged despite the object, being in motion. If two friends remain seated face to face in a running train, then the relative position of one \\nwith respect to other does not change. So one is said to have in rest with respect to other. \\nWhen a person observes these two friends standi ng by the side of the train line he will \\nsee their position is changing with respect to him. That is both the two friends are in \\nmotion with respect to the person standing by the side of the train line.   \\nSo we see that an object is actually in rest or not depends on the reference object. If the \\nreference frame is actually in rest, object in re st will be : actually in rest with respect to \\nthat frame. This type of rest is called absolute rest. A body is said to be in absolutely rest \\nwhen it is in rest with respect to an absolutely rest object.  \\nSimilarly absolute motion of a body is its motion with respect to a reference object \\nabsolutely at rest. But in this universe it is not possible to get a reference object which is at absolute rest. Since the earth is continuously moving round the sun, while the sun itself is moving along the galaxy with its planets and satellites. Thus when we say that a body is at rest or in motion, we mean it is to be so with respect to a body apparently at rest. So we can say that in this universe all rest and all motion are relative. No rest or no \\nmotion is absolute.  \\nMitu is waiting for a bus at the bus stand to go somewhere. She notices her friend Roni \\ncrossing her by rickshaw. She says that the rickshaw is in motion because it is changing \\nits position continuously with respect to time.  \\nThe change of position of a body may take place in two ways.  \\nLet us consider the following example :  \\na) Mou is standing under a tree and sees that her friend Awishi is running away from \\nher. So the distance between Mou and Awishi is increasing with time.  \\nb) A large circular tract is made in the school field of Raju for race of annual sports. He \\nnotices his friend Shihab practicing to running along that track standing at the centre of the trac (Fig 2.1 (b)). Raju says Shihab is in motion but the distance between them is not \\nchanging with time. How it can be said that Shihab is in motion with respect to Raju.  \\n \\n '),\n",

In the second example, the position of Shihab is changing \\nwith respect to Raju with time but the distance is not changing. What is changing then ? \\nThe direction of position of Shihab is changing with respect to Raju. The position of a moving body with respect to an observer can be taken place either indirection or in \\ndistance or by both.  \\n2.2 Types of motion  Linear motion :  If a body is in motion along a straight line, that is, if the motion of a \\nbody is restricted on a straight line its motion is called linear motion. The motion of a car in a straight street is linear motion.  \\nRotational motion : When a body rotates around a particular point or an axis keeping \\nthe distance of the particles of the body unchanged is called rotational motion. For \\nexample, motion of an electric fan, motion of the heads of a clock.  \\nRectilinear motion : When a body moves along a straight line in such a way that each \\nparticle of the body travels the same distance at the same time in the same direction.  \\nIf a book is pushed to shift from one end to the other of a table without rotation, the \\nmotion will be rectilinear because all the particles of the book travel the equal distance, \\nat equal time in the same direction.  \\nPeriodic motion : If the motion of a moving particle is such that it passes through a \\ndefinite point along the path of its motion in th e same direction in a definite interval of \\ntime, this type of motion is called periodic motion. This motion can be circular, elliptical \\nor rectilinear. The motion of the hands of a clock, the motion of earth round the sun, the motion of piston in the cylinder of a steam or petrol engine etc.      \\nThe time interval at which a particle of periodic motion passes through a definite point \\nfrom the same direction repeatedly is called its time period.  \\nVibratory motion : If a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction \\nfor one half of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then '),\n",

Motion of a simple pendulum, motion of \\nvibrating tuning fork and the motion of string of guitar.   \\n2.3 Scalar and vector quantities :  \\nAnything that can be measured in this physi cal world is called a physical quantity. When \\na physical quantity is measured, it has got a magnitude. We express this magnitude in \\nterms of a number and a unit. For example, if we say that the height of the bench is 1.5 \\nmeter, we mean that the unit of length is meter and height of the bench is 1.5 times this unit. But all physical quantities cannot be completely expressed by its magnitude only. \\nTo express not only magnitude of some quantities is needed but also the direction.    \\nFor example, if we say that a car is running at the speed of 40 km per hour, it is \\nunderstood that the car moves a distance 40 km in one hour, but the direction of motion \\nof the car cannot be known from this statement. To know the actual position of the car, the direction of the motion should also be stated. So, we can see, to express some of the \\nquantities completely direction is needed with the magnitude of the quantities. In \\nconsideration of direction all quantities of the world we can divide into two category. Such as \\n        1. In-directional quantity or Scalar quantity  \\n        2. Directional quantity or Vector quantity  \\nScalar quantity : Physical quantities which can be fully expressed by magnitude only \\nare called scalar quantities. Length, mass, speed, work, energy, time, temperature etc are \\nthe examples of scalar quantities.  \\nVector quantity :  Physical quantity which need both magnitude and direction to be \\nfully expressed are called vector quantities. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, electric intensity etc are the examples of vector quantities.  \\nTable 2.1 Shows that vectors are expressed by magnitude and direction whereas scalars \\nare expressed by magnitude only.  \\nTable 2.1 \\nExamples of scalar and vector quantities \\nScalar Quantity Vector quantity \\nDistance  d 40m Displacement s 40m east direction  \\nSpeed  v 30ms-1 Velocity v 30 ms-1 north direction  \\nTime  t 15s Force  F 100N upward direction \\nEnergy  E 2000j Acceleration  a 98ms-2 downward direction   \\n '),\n",

For \\nexample, A or  A  , where   A   represents, the magnitude of the vector quantity   A. Sometimes bold A instead of A is used to represent a vector and an ordinary A to \\nrepresent its magnitude. The vector quantities in the table 2.1 are represented by bold \\nletter.        \\nIn figure, a vector quantity represented by an arrow \\nheaded straight line. The length of the straight line \\nrepresents the magnitude and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector. For example, in \\nfigure 2.2 displacement of 50km has been \\nrepresented by 1cm. Hence the vector A in this figure, whose length is 3cm represents a \\ndisplacement of 150km towards west. The vector B \\nrepresents a displacement of 100km towards north at an angle of 30\\n0 with the east. \\n2.4 Different quantities related to motion  Distance and Displacement: Suppose, Ovi ran 100m from his school gate. It is true that \\nOvi is 100m away from the gate, but it does not tell the \\nexact position of Ovi. Because Ovi can be 100m away to the east, to the west, to the north, to the south or any other \\ndirections. To know exactly the change of position of Ovi, \\nthe direction towards which he moved 100m should also be known. If it is stated that Ovi ran 100m from the gate to the \\neast then his exact position will be known definitely. If you \\ngo straight to the east from the gate you will find Ovi at a distance of 100m. The physical quantity which was first \\nused to indicate the change of position of Ovi is  distance. This is a scalar quantity. In the \\nsecond case, direction has also been mentioned along with distance, this is called displacement. This is a vector quantity. Change of position or distance in a definite \\ndirection is displacement. So, the change of position of an object with respect to its \\nsurrounding in a definite direction is called displacement. \\nThe minimum distance, that is, the linear distance between the initial and final position \\nof a body is the magnitude of its displacement at its direction is towards final position \\nfrom the initial position.  \\nThe displacement does not depend on the path of the object. An object can move from \\nposition A to position B following different paths. But its displacement will be from A Fig-2.2 \\nFig-2.3 W E\\nS N '),\n",

The minimum distance between A and B, that is, in this case the linear \\ndistance AB is the magnitude of displacements. AB and its direction is towards B from \\nA. Here, it is a vector quantity, since displacement has both magnitude and direction.     \\nThe dimension of displacement is the same as that of distance.   Therefore, [ s ] = L  \\nThe unit of displacement is the same as that of distance that is meter (m). The \\ndisplacement of a body is 50m towards north means that the body has moved 50m from its initial position towards north direction.  \\nSpeed :  Suppose in the previous example, Ovi takes 50 seconds, to travel 100m \\ndistance. If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time.   \\nSuppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say \\nOvi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster. \\nLet the particular time be 1 second therefore,  \\nIn 1 second Ovi travels 100\\n50\\n  = 2 meter \\nIn 1 second Mitu travels 75\\n30 = 2.5 meter \\nSo, Mitu goes faster than Ovi because in 1 second Mitu travels more distance than Ovi.  \\nFrom the above discussion we can understand time and distance determines who goes \\nfaster.  \\nThe quantity by which we can measure how fa st a body moves or distance traveled, is \\ncalled speed. Speed expresses the rate of change position of a body. The rate of change \\nof position of a body with time is called the speed.  \\nSpeed of a body is measured by the distance traveled per unit time. i.e  \\nSpeed = distance\\ntime  \\nIf a moving body travels a distance `d’ in time `t’ then the speed v is  \\n   The direction of rate of change of position of the body cannot be known by the speed. So \\nit has no direction. Therefore, speed is a scalar quantity.    '),\n",

The speedometer of car measures the speed in kmh-1 .  \\nAverage Speed : If the magnitude of speed does not change during the motion of the \\nbody, that is if the body travels equal distance in equal interval of time, then the speed of \\nthe body is called uniform speed. And if the body does not travel equal distance in equal \\ninterval of time then the speed is called non uniform speed.  \\nIf a body does not move with uniform speed, then the speed obtained by dividing the \\ntotal distance traveled by time is called average speed.  \\nSo, average speed =   total distance\\ntime  \\nIf a car runs 300 km in 6 hours since 7 in the morning on the way from Dhaka to \\nDinajpur, the average speed of the car is 300km/6h = 50kmh-1. Here, average speed \\n50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel \\nsometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed.  \\nInstantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any \\ninstant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel \\nis over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. To find the \\ninstantaneous speed at any instant, the distance traveled at during a small interval, has to be known and then the distance has to be divided by the time interval.  \\nIf any one wants to the speed of the car at 10 : 32 : 43 am ( 10 hours 32 minute 43 \\nsecond) or at the time of cross over a speed breaker on the highway beside any school, \\nhe has to see the reading of the speedometer at the moment. Similarly with the help of Rudder or Laser gun we can know whether a car is violating the highest limit on the \\nhighway or the speed every ball of Mashrafi Bin Murtaja, the fastest bowler of \\nBangladesh national team.  \\nVelocity : Sometimes during usual conversation many people use the word velocity to \\nmean speed. But in science the two words do  not mean the same thing speed indicates \\nonly the rate of change of position with time, it does not indicate the direction of change '),\n",

The velocity states the rate of ch ange of position along with its direction that \\nis, velocity means the rate of change of position in a definite direction or in other words \\nthe rate of change of displacement. Hence velocity of a body is its rate of change of \\ndisplacement with time, that is the distance traveled by a moving body in unit time in a \\ndefinite direction is called the velocity of the body.  \\nIf a body travels a distance s in a definite direction in time t the velocity is v = 3\\nt   \\nThe dimension of velocity is the same as that of speed, i.e [ LT-1 ]  \\n The unit of velocity is ms-1 the same as that of \\nspeed. Velocity has both magnitude and direction. So, velocity is a vector quantity. A road may be \\ntaken as an example at some place the road has \\nmade a 30\\n0 angle with east and has gone straight \\ntowards north (Fig 2.4). On this road, if a car \\nmoves with a uniform speed of 20kmh-1 then we \\nwill be able to state correctly that the velocity of the car is 20 kmh\\n-1 towards north at an angle 300 \\nwith east. But if the same car moves in a circular road with uniform speed of 20kmh\\n-1 than the \\ndirection of its motion will be continuously \\nchanged. So its velocity will also be changed continuously, although its speed will \\nalways remain the same. The magnitude of the velocity of a body is its speed. The specific directional speed is its velocity.    \\nIf the magnitude and direction of the velocity of a moving body remains unchanged, then \\nthe velocity of the body as called uniform or equal velocity. The velocity of sound is a \\ngood example of natural phenomenon of uniform velocity. Sound travels in a definite direction over equal distances in equal intervals of time and it is 332ms\\n-1 in Air at 00c. \\nSound travels in a definite direction through a distance of 332m in the 1st second, 332m \\nin the 2nd second and so on for every second. Here the magnitude and the direction of the \\nvelocity of sound remains the same. So the velocity of sound 332ms-1 is a uniform \\nvelocity.  \\nIf the magnitude or direction or both of the velocity of a moving body changes during its \\nmotion, then its velocity is called variable or uniform velocity. In other words if the body does not move through equal distance in equal intervals of time or changes its direction \\nof motion while moving then its velocity will be variable. Usually we moving, car runs \\non the road etc. are the uniform velocity.  \\nAcceleration and Retardation : If a body does not move with uniform velocity then the \\nmagnitude or direction or both of the velocity may change. We say that there is \\nacceleration of a body if its velocity changes. Suppose a car is moving along a straight Fig-2.4  N \\nS WE'),\n",

Hence the values of `g’’ is not the same at all places \\non earth. The polar radius `R’ is the shortest and so the value of `g’ at the pole is the \\nmaximum. And the value of R is the longest at the equator. So the value of `g’ at the equation is the minimum. \\nSince the value of `g’ is different at different places on the surface of the earth, its value \\nat sea level altitude 45 ° is accepted as the standard value.

Since the acceleration due to gravity does not dropped on the mass of the body, the acceleration of the stone and that of the paper \\nwould be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the \\nresistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth. If there is no resistance of the air, they would fall at the same time.  \\nLaws of falling bodies :  Galilio discovered three laws relating to falling bodies : These are called laws of \\nfalling bodies. These laws are applicable onl y for bodies falling from rest without any \\nresistance. At the time of falling, the body will ``fall from rest, it will have no initial \\nvelocity. The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the \\ngravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it.  \\nLaws of falling bodies are :  \\nFirst Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance \\ntraverse equal distance in equal time.  \\nSecond Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given \\ntime (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v \\n∝ t   '),\n",

Some of them are in rest and some of them \\nare in motion. Among the bodies in rest, there are chair, table, houses, log of wood etc. \\nCan a body in rest move itself? Tonight your reading table is in a certain place. Will it be in the same place in the next morning? What do we observe from these practical \\nexperiences? It is observed that the bodies at rest are still at rest. These bodies can’t \\nmove by themselves. Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We \\nfind that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move \\ncontinuously if there is no air resistance and friction?  \\nFrom this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the \\nsame state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the \\nbody is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to \\nmaintain its own state is called inertia. Thus  the tendency of a body to maintain its own \\nstate for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that \\nstate is defined as inertia.  \\nThe inertia of a body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The \\nmore the mass, the more the inertia of a body. In other words, it is difficult to move, increase or decrease velocity or change the di rection of velocity of a body whose inertia \\nis large.  \\nDo yourself \\n• Keep a pen and a book on a table. Now st rike the pen with finger. What do you \\nobserve? The pen moved a small distance on the table.  \\n• Now repeat this procedure for the book. The book won’t move. Now push the book \\nwith your hand. The book will be displaced from its original position.  \\nBetween the pen and the book, it needs more effort to move the book as the mass i.e. the \\ninertia of the book is greater. \\nExample of inertia \\nIf a bus at rest suddenly starts moving the passengers lean backwards. The reason behind \\nthis is inertia. When the bus is at rest, the bodies of the passengers are also at rest. When \\nthe bus starts moving, the part of the passenger’s body attached to the bus also moves \\nwith it. But the upper part of the body tends to remain stationary due to inertia of rest. \\nThus the upper part of the body lags behind with respect to the lower part. As a result the passenger inclines backwards. On the other hand, when a sudden brake is applied in a \\nmoving bus the passengers lean forwards. When a bus is in motion, the passenger of the \\nbus is also in the same speed of the bus. When the bus stops suddenly, the lower part of '),\n",

But the upper part of the passenger’s \\nbody moves forward due to inertia of motion. \\nDuring car driving the drivers wear seat belt for safety. What is the reason? The reason \\nbehind this is inertia. If he doesn’t use seat belt, he would lean forward due to inertia of \\nmotion for applying fast brake. For this reason he would hit the steering and other bodies in front of him, for this a serious accident may happen. Not only have the drivers, the \\npassengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car. \\nWe have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or \\npush a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied \\nforce can cease the motion of the body or trie s to increase its velocity. In both cases to \\napply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they \\ncan apply force on each other. Such a well- known force is the force of gravitation, \\nwhose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or \\nattraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In \\nthis way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. \\nFor example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force \\nbetween two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus. \\nNow we will see how we can get concept about inertia and force from Newton’s first \\nlaw of motion. Newton’s first law of motion is- \\n‘Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line \\nunless an external force is applied to it.’ \\nNewton’s first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton’s first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its \\nown. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as \\ninertia. Thus from the Newton’s first law of motion we get the concept of inertia. \\nAgain from Newton’s first law we see that to change the state of a body something \\nexternal must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change \\nthe state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton’s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton’s first law, a force is that which acting on a \\nbody at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or \\ntends to change its state of motion.

Nature of them is of \\ndifferent types. Some of them are produced due to direct contact between two bodies.  In addition, there are some forces which do not need direct contact between two bodies. \\nThe force which needs direct contact between two bodies to be created is defined as \\ncontact force. When we push or pull a body with hand our hand exerts a force on the body at that time. This push or pull force is  contact force. Since this force is the \\nconsequence of the direct contact between the hand and the body. The examples of \\ncontact forces are- frictional force, pulling force and the force created during collision.  \\nWhen a body tends to move or move over another body, then a resistive frictional force \\nis produced against the motion between the contact surfaces of two bodies. Here the frictional force is produced due to direct c ontact between the surfaces of the two bodies. \\nWe apply pulling force on a box when we pull it over the floor. At that time frictional \\nforce is produced opposite to the motion of the box. \\nNon-Contact force: \\nThe force which acts without direct contact between two bodies is called non-contact force. The attractive gravitational force betw een two bodies, the attractive or repulsive \\nelectric force between two charged bodies, th e attractive or repulsive force between two \\npoles of two magnets, the force of attrac tion acting between a magnet and a magnetic \\nmaterial are the examples of non-contact force or distant force.  \\nDo yourself:   Release a pen or pencil or any object from your hand. \\nThe body will fall down. Something is pulli ng the body downward certainly. Who is \\npulling?  Here, the earth is pulling the body towards it, though there is no direct \\nconnection between the body and the earth i.e. the earth is not in contact with the body. \\nHere the earth is applying force of gravitation on the body. The force of gravitation is a non-contact force. Any two body of the univers e exert force of gravitation on each other. \\nWhen the earth exerts force of gravitation on another body, then this force is called \\ngravity. \\nThough we observe different kinds of force in nature, fundamental force are of four \\ntypes. Rest of them is some forms of these fundamental forces. The forces which are root or independent i.e. the forces which are not produced from some other forces or not any \\nforms of some other forces are called fundamental forces. Instead, other forces are some \\nforms of these fundamental forces. '),\n",

Force of gravitation \\n2. Electromagnetic force \\n3. Weak nuclear force \\n4. Strong nuclear force \\nForce of Gravitation: \\nIn this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual \\nattraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of \\ngravitation extends to infinity. \\nElectromagnetic force: \\nThe electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or \\nbodies on each other due to their charges. Th is force may be of both types- attractive or \\nrepulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between \\nthe charged particles.  \\n Weak nuclear force \\nThe short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles \\nwithin the nucleus is called weak nuclear fo rce. Due to this force the nucleus becomes \\nunstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to \\nweak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10\\n-16 m. \\nStrong nuclear force \\nIt is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of \\nan atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10\\n-15 m \\nwhich is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental \\nforces. '),\n",

The forces that produce this \\nbalanced condition are called balanced forces.  \\nIt is seen in figure 3.1 that an object is suspended \\nwith a thread. The force of attraction of earth on the object i.e. the weight of the object W is acting \\nvertically downward. The tension of the thread T is \\nacting vertically upward. Here the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction thus \\ncanceling each other’s action and producing a \\nbalanced condition.  \\nOnly the attractive force of the earth i.e. the force of \\ngravity will act on the object if the thread is cut. Then the object will fall down with acceleration due \\nto gravity. Here, the force of gravity or weight of the \\nobject is the unbalanced force. If the body is displaced slightly along one side, the tension of the \\nthread T and the weight W will not be in a straight \\nline. Then a resultant force will act on the body without creating balanced condition. Due to this, the \\nbody will oscillate. This is an example of unbalanced \\nforce. \\nAnother example of balanced and unbalanced forces \\ncan be seen in the game of tug-of-war competition. In this game, a handkerchief is tied to the center of the rope. In this competition equal \\nnumbers of competitors pull on the rope in two sides and try to move the handkerchief to \\ntheir side. If the handkerchief does not move then it is understood that either the team are applying equal amount of force and the rope or the handkerchief is in balanced \\ncondition. Here, forces applied by the two teams are balanced forces.  \\nIf one team applies more force than the other, then the resultant force will act along them \\nthus creating unbalanced force and the handkerchief will move to their side. Then this team will be declared as the winning team in the competition.  \\n \\nFig. 3.4: Tug-of-war (unbalanced force) Fig. 3.1 \\nFig. 3.2 \\nFig. 3.3 '),\n",

Momentum depends on the mass and velocity of the body. Think about a loaded truck and a private car. You have to stop both the cars within the same distance. Which car needs hard brake to stop? The answer is truck. Though the truck and the car are moving with the same speed, the truck possesses that physical quantity which is more is its momentum.  \\nMomentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop something that is moving. \\nMomentum is related to the force. This relation is obtained quantitatively in Newton’s second law of motion.  \\nMomentum is the product of the mass and velocity of a moving body.  Let, the mass of a body\\nm=  \\n    Velocity =  v \\n            ∴ Momentum = mv                                   (3.1) \\nMomentum is a vector quantity. Its direction is in the direction of velocity. It is observed \\nfrom equation (3.1) that the momentum of a body will be large if the body has a large mass and moving faster. \\nUnit: the unit of momentum is, unit of mass × unit of velocity, i.e. \\n-1kg×ms  or -1kg ms . \\nIf a body of 1 kg moves with a velocity of 1ms-1, its momentum will be 1kg ms-1. \\nDimension:  The dimension of momentum:  [p] = MLT-1.  \\n3.5 Effect of force on motion \\nA force can cause a stationary object to start moving. \\nWhat happens when a stationary football is kicked by a player? It is seen that the ball \\nmoves off in the direction it is kicked from its stationary state. In this case the ball accelerates from rest. Here acceleration is positive,  and in the same direction as the force \\nexerted by the kick. \\nA force can cause a moving object to increase its velocity. \\nWhat would be the velocity when a cricke t ball is hit by the batsman in the same \\ndirection as the ball moves? It is observed that the ball moves faster after the hit. In this case the acceleration is positive and its veloc ity increases. The velocity of a moving \\nmarble increases if it is stroked in same direction as it moves.  \\nA force can cause a moving object to decrease speed. \\nThink you are riding a bicycle in the village road. After a while you observed that the \\nroad is slanting downwards. Now what will you do? Will you continue the pedaling as '),\n",

You have to apply brake to cross this sloping road safely. Due to \\nthis, the cycle decelerates.  \\nA force can cause a moving object to chan ge its velocity or direction of motion. \\nA batsman hits the cricket ball coming from opposite direction during a game of cricket. \\nDue to the hit, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the ball change. The ball moves in a different direction due to this hit by the bat. In this case too, the ball has \\nacceleration.  \\nEffect of forces on shape  \\nThere are many examples around us where the shape of a body changes by the \\napplication of force. The shape of an empty plastic bottle changes when it is pressed. Again when a rubber band is stretched by pulling it, it becomes narrow and its shape \\nchanges.  \\nSometimes, the changes of shape of the bodies are temporary in nature. Sometimes, the \\nshape of the object is permanently changed due to the application of force. Such changes \\noccur in the crushed metallic can or a car after a collision.  \\nA temporary change of shape may provide a useful way of absorbing and storing energy. \\nCompressing the spring by rotation of the key th e potential energy is stored in a toy car. \\nWhen the car is released the potential en ergy is transformed into kinetic energy. A \\npermanent change of shape may mean the failure of a structure- as a bridge collapse due \\nto excess load. \\n3.6 Relation between force and acceleration- Newton’s second law \\nNewton’s first law gives qualitative definition of force. Newton’s second law gives the \\nequation for the measurement of force. From Newton’s second law we know the relationship between the force acting on a body and the acceleration produced due to this \\nforce. The law is as follows: \\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on \\nit and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. \\nLet a body of mass m is moving with an initial velocity u. Now a constant force F acts \\non the body for a time t in the direction of its velocity.

In figure 3.5 if the object P exerts a force F\\n1 on the object Q, then according to this law, the object Q will also exert \\nan equal and opposite force F 2 on the object P. The force exerted by the object P on \\nobject Q is called action force and the force exerted by Q on P is called reaction force.  \\n \\nFigure 3.5 \\nTherefore, according to Newton’s third law, F1 = - F 2 \\nIt is noticeable that the action and reaction force act on different bodies. The reaction \\nforce will exist as long as the there is action.  \\nExample: \\nWalking on road \\nIn our daily life we walk or run on the ground [Figure 3.6]. When we walk on the \\nground, we exert a backward force on the ground by the leg behind obliquely. This is the action force. According to the third law a reaction force is produced opposite to this.

What is the reason \\nbehind this? In this case, action and reaction force of bullet and gun exists for the same time. According to the Newton’s second law of motion, the bullet and the gun acquire \\nequal and opposite momentum. As a result the bullet moves forward with a particular \\nmomentum and the gun moves backward with a momentum of same magnitude but opposite in direction. Due to this, the person will feel a backward thrust. The backward \\nvelocity of the gun will be smaller in comparison to that of the bullet as the mass of the \\ngun is large. \\nCollision \\nAmong you, those who have played marble probably had seen how one marble hits \\nanother marble. In addition, you are familiar with different types of road accident through newspapers or television. These events are the practical examples of collision.  \\nTherefore, when a moving object hits another body at rest or in motion, then it is said \\nthat a collision has taken place. During collision a force acts on each of the two bodies. \\nIf the force exerted by the first body on the second body is called action force, then the force exerted by the second body on the first one is called the reaction force. These two \\nforces acting during collision are same in magnitude but opposite in direction. No other \\nexternal force acts during the collision except the action and reaction force. From Newton’s second law we get, \\nmv muFt−=  \\nWe can express the change of momentum from this equation as- \\n                                    F t mv mu×=−                                         (3.4)  \\ni.e.  force × time = change of momentum. \\nThe product of force and time is defined as impulse of force. Therefore, impulse of force = change of momentum \\n Let two bodies A and B having masses m\\n1 and m 2 are moving with velocities u 1 and u 2 \\nrespectively along a straight line. If the velocity of A is greater than that of B, at any time the object A will collide with the object B [Figure 3.7].  The force exerted on B by \\nA is the action F\\n1. The object B will also exert a force F 2 on A, this F 2 is the reaction \\nforce. According to Newton’s third law of motion, 12FF=− \\n \\nFigure: 3.7 '),\n",

We travel in a car to \\nmeet the necessity of our daily lives. We use different vehicles during the journey. Sometimes in bus or train or we use personal vehicles. The speed of a vehicle and force \\nis inseparably related to each other during the journey in such vehicles. The speed of a \\ncar plays a vital role for a safe journey. The speed or velocity would not be such that which is not controllable. To travel in a dist ant destination, it is necessary to know about \\nthe road condition and environment.  \\nThe driver has to check the car well before start journey. As an example, whether the \\ntyre or brake is perfectly right or not. He has to ensure whether the engine, used battery, \\nfront and rear lamps, wiper, and signal lights of two sides are right and properly working. In addition, he has to properly adjust the mirrors used in the car. \\nAt first the driver and the passengers will w ear the seat belt during driving time. It is \\nobserved that most of the road accidents occu r due to very fast driving. So, the driver \\nmust be cautious to control the speed of the car. The kinetic energy becomes more due to \\nincreased speed.  For example- if the velocity of the car is doubled, its kinetic energy is increased by four times in comparison to th at of the earlier value. If the velocity is \\nincreased by three times, kinetic energy is increased by nine times. Then it becomes \\ndifficult to reduce or to control the velocity and the accident becomes terrible.  \\nDrivers are advised to choose a vehicle which th ey are used to driving earlier. It is not \\nwise to try to drive a new vehicle suddenly. It is observed that the youth try to drive a new car emotionally. It’s not proper at all. Slow down the vehicle’s speed when you \\nmeet other vehicles from opposite direction. To obey the traffic sign and traffic law is \\nthe citizen responsibility of the vehicle driv er. The driver should concentrate on driving \\nabsolutely during driving.  \\n3.9 Friction and force of friction We are familiar with friction in various ways in our daily lives. From Newton’s first law \\nof motion we know that if no force acts on a body the body will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. Does it actually happen in reality? Take a \\nmarble and roll it on the floor. When you roll the marble, you apply a force on it. As a \\nresult, the marble becomes mobile on the ground. According to Newton’s law the marble should remain in uniform velocity. In practice, it is seen that the marble comes to rest \\nafter traversing a small distance. This happens due to the friction of the floor. When the \\nmarble is in motion on the floor, a frictional force is developed due to the mutual friction between the marble and the floor. This force acts in the direction opposite to the motion \\nand hinders the motion. If the friction of the floor was absent, then the marble would \\ncontinue its perpetual motion with uniform velocity.  When a body moves or tends to move over another body, then a resistance is developed \\nbetween the two surfaces in contact, which is known as friction. This resistive force is \\ncalled frictional force. '),\n",

The que stion arises- why friction occur? Friction is \\nthe result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. \\nAgain, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed \\nby a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves \\nof the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.  \\nAs the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface \\nbecome rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then \\nthe magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can \\novercome the resistance of the surface in contact. The frictional force causes the object to slow down and stop thereby.  \\n \\nFigure: 3.8 \\nTypes of friction \\nGenerally there are four types of friction.  \\n1. Static friction \\n2. Sliding friction \\n3. Rolling friction \\n4. Fluid friction \\nStatic friction Static friction is the friction between two surfaces that aren't moving relatively to each \\nother.  \\nWhen a force is applied to an object, but it does not cause it to move, then static friction \\nworks. When a massive body on a floor is pulled by a force but it does not move, then the frictional force created is called force of static friction. The static frictional force is \\ndeveloped opposite to the applied force and acts until motion is produced. \\nWhen two bodies at rest are in contact with one another and one body is made to move \\non the other body, the friction produced between them until a relative motion is created \\nis called static friction. \"),\n",

When a \\nhard brake is applied on a car moving fast, the car does not stop rather cross a small \\ndistance by sliding. \\nRolling friction \\nRolling friction is friction between a rolling object and the surface that it is rolling on.  \\nThe wheel’s motion of a cycle, motion of marble is example of rolling friction.    During \\ntravelling we use luggage carrier having wheels to carry goods. If there was no wheel in the luggage carrier then it was too difficult to pull it by sliding from one place to another. Due to the attachment of wheel it becomes easier to pull it i.e. the force of \\nrolling friction is less than that of the static friction.  \\nFluid friction \\nWhen an object moves in a fluid i.e. a liquid or gas, the friction acts is called fluid \\nfriction.  \\nWe have to overcome a barrier in water while swimming in the pond. This barrier is the \\nfluid friction. A parachute works by harnessing the air resistance. The air resistance is a \\ntype of frictional force which works against the force of gravity of the earth. As an open parachute has a large surface area, it helps provide enough air resistance. As a result, the sky-diver’s falling speed is decreased mostly . So, the skydiver will then be able to \\ndescend slowly and safely.  \\n3.10 Effects of friction on motion \\nFriction has enormous influence on the motion of an object. Friction is \\na kind of resistive force which slows down the motion of a body. Though friction creates many problems in our daily lives, it plays a \\nvital role for movement and vehicle operaration. In this section we \\nshall discuss about tyre’s surface, smoothness of road and role of friction for controlling motion. \\nTyre’s surface \\nDriving vehicles is possible because of the friction between the tyres and the road \\nsurface. The friction force between the tyres and the road depends on condition of the \\ntyres and surface of the road. It also depends on the weight of the vehicle. The tyre’s \\nrubber surface is designed with treads i.e. grooves or teeth. The tyre surface is up and \\ndown due to these grooves. If the tyre is new, these grooves are distinct; as a result the \\nforce of friction between the tyre and the road is maximum. When the tyre becomes old, Figure: 3.9 '),\n",

As a result the frictional force \\nbetween the tyre and the road decreased mostly. Say, what inconvenience may arise due \\nto this.  \\nSmoothness of road \\nThe smoothness of road has a great impact on the motion of a body. When the road is \\nsmooth, movement of vehicles on the road becomes easier and the journey becomes comfortable. As the road becomes smoother, the resistive force of friction becomes \\nlesser. The magnitude of the frictional force between the car’s tyre and the road depends \\non the smoothness of the tyre as well as on the smoothness of the road. Many types of problems arise when amount of the frictional force is decreased largely. So, the road \\nshould not be too smooth. If the road is too smooth, it is not possible to stop the car \\nwithin a certain distance in spite of applying brake. The friction is important for the motion of a car. If the road is too smooth, the necessary reaction force is not produced. \\nThe amount of the frictional force is largely reduced when the road is too smooth, as a \\nresult the car will not be able to move forward. So, the smoothness of the road will be such that it can supply the necessary frictional force. \\nControlling motion and braking force \\nThe speed of the vehicle has to increase or decrease according to the necessity at the \\ntime of vehicle movement. That is, we have to control the motion of a vehicle.  \\nBrake is such an arrangement, which controls the speed of the car or rotation of the \\nwheels according to the necessity by increasing the friction. With this it is possible to \\nhalt a vehicle in a certain place. When the dr iver applies the brakes, the shoe or pad \\nmade of asbestos press the metallic disc on the wheel. The friction between the pad and \\ndisc slows down the wheel’s speed. As a result, the velocity of a car decreases.      \\n3.11 Increasing and decreasing friction \\nFriction is inextricably related to our daily lives. Friction can be increased in necessity; \\nagain friction can be decreased too in necessity. How friction can be decrease and increase would be discussed in this section. \\nReducing friction \\nSmoothing the surface \\nFriction  makes many troubles to displace one body from one place to another. Let, you \\nwant to displace a massive box on the floor. If the friction of the contact surface is large \\nenough, then it takes a lot of labor to displace it. By polishing or smoothing the surface it can be decreased. '),\n",

The wheel is an ingenious \\ninvention. Its circular shape reduces friction to a minimum. Without wheel was it possible to use this machinery?  Using wheel  in a suitcase reduces the friction and it \\nbecomes easier to pull it. The value of the rolling friction in comparison to the sliding \\nfriction is reduced greatly due to the attachment of wheels.  \\nUsing lubricants \\nOil, mobil and grease like materials are called lubricants or greasy materials in short. A \\nlayer of lubricant between the two surfaces can greatly reduce the friction. So, lubricants are used between the moving parts of an engine. In addition, we use oil in sewing \\nmachine, lock and hinges.  \\nUsing ball bearings  \\nAnother important invention similar to the wheel is the invention of ball bearing. It was \\npossible to reduce the friction greatly between the surfaces by using ball bearing. Ball bearings are the small, smooth metal balls. Generally these are made of steel. Ball bearings are placed between the moving parts of a machine. They roll around so that the moving parts of the machine do not rub against each other directly. That is, the surfaces roll over one another instead of sliding and friction reduces. There are uses of ball \\nbearing in car’s wheel, cycle and electric fan [Figure 3.10].  \\n \\nFigure 3.10 \\nIncreasing friction \\nDriving cars \\nWithout friction in the road, the tyres of a car will just spin around at the same spot. \\nPossibly you have seen how truck and bus is blocked in a slippery or muddy road in the rainy days. What is the reason behind this? This is due to the large decrease in friction. So friction is to be increased according to the necessity. The car tyres are so designed that they are able to grip the road properly and create necessary frictional force. Therefore the surface of the tyres are designed with treads i.e. grooves and teeth.  In the rainy days, the water or mud enters the grooves and water and mud are thrown outside \\nboldly. As a result, the tyres are able to grip the road surface well.  '),\n",

They use chalk powder to grip the rock. \\nThere are spikes under the boot of players so that they do not fall down while running. 3.12 Friction: a necessary evil \\n Though friction has many disadvantages it is considered as a necessary evil. What \\ncauses it?  We cannot do anything without the force of friction. If there was no friction, the motion of a body would not cease at all a nd continue perpetually. Due to friction, a \\nnail is fixed in a wall. It became possible to construct buildings and houses because of friction. Friction has made it possible to write on a paper with a pencil or a pen. We can walk as there is a friction between our shoes and the ground. We can change the direction of motion of a car owing to friction. Using a parachute it is possible to descend safely to the ground by harnessing the air resistance. In spite of having so many advantages we have to suffer a lot for friction. Because of excess friction the vehicles cannot move easily. Any device that has moving parts can wear out and tear due to friction. In any type of vehicles- may be car, boat or airplane, extra fuel has to be spent \\nto overcome the excess friction. Fuel energy is being wasted because of friction. \\nThe energy that is wasted for friction mainly appears as heat energy. Not only that \\nenergy is converted to heat due to friction, but also the parts of an engine may be overheated.  As a result of friction, the soles of your shoes wear and tear out. So to make the life and works easier we need friction but excess friction is the cause of many losses too. Therefore to produce the necessary friction, we have to control it. Sometimes we need to increase or decrease friction by some processes. Therefore, we cannot discard friction totally; also friction is beneficial to  us in many cases. For this reason friction is \\ncalled a necessary evil.  \\nPreparing report \\nPresent a report to your teacher about the positive impact of friction in our life in the light of \\nsection 3.9 to 3.12. \\nTeacher will select the best report and tell the student to present in the class room.  \\nInvestigation 3.1: Measurement of force acting on a body \\nObjective: To measure force by simple experiment Formula: We know, if a force F acts on a body of mass m and the resulting acceleration \\ndue to the force is a, then F=ma .

In science the term work represents a definite concept. A gateman guards a house all day long sitting at a place and can say he has done his work. A boat was floating with \\nthe current of a river or canal and Mr. Karim was pulling it back. He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push \\ncart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. \\nLet us consider the following examples: \\na) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. \\nb) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. \\nc) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. \\nd) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. \\nAs work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in \\nthe above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the \\nshape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. \\nIf a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he \\nhas to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the \\ndirection of force. Therefore, \\nWork = Force × Distance travelled along the direction of force \\nIf a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of \\nforce (fig: 4.1) then the work done ( W) will be, \\nW= Fs… … … (4.1) \\nWork has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. \\nDimension of Work: \\n Dimension of work will be the dimension of force × dimension of displacement \\nFigure: 4.1 '),\n",

Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. \\nMathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m. \\nHow much work will he do?

The \\namount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work.

Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. \\nThe energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of \\nenergy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can \\ndo is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the \\namount of work done is the amount of energy used.  \\nTherefore, Work done = Energy used \\nEnergy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy \\nWe need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need \\nheat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical \\nenergy is necessary to operate an electrical  device. We get chemical energy by chemical \\nreaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is \\nreleased when the atoms are accumulated or broken. \\nThe universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be \\nmotionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We \\ncan move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric \\nenergy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. \\nGenerally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat \\nenergy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, \\nnuclear energy and solar energy. \\nThe most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a \\nbody due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will \\ndiscuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and \\npotential energy is produced due to the position of object.  \\nKinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it \\ndown. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. \\nFrom the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of \\ndoing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. \\nDo it yourself:  Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the \\npen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. \\nWhy does the object displace from its initial pos ition? This is because the hit makes the \\npen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. \\nCreating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to \\nproduce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done \\non the body. For this the body will obtain the ab ility to work and this work will be stored '),\n",

This is why all moving objects are in possession of \\nkinetic energy. The body will be able to perform this amount of work before it rests. \\nLet a force F be applied on a body of mass m at rest. The body attains a velocity v. \\nSuppose the body moves a distance s in the direction of the force. The work done to \\nproduce this velocity of the body is its kinetic energy.  \\nTherefore,   \\nKinetic energy = Work done              = Force × displacement \\n  = F × s  \\nor,                 E\\nk = mas; [ as, F = ma] \\n \\nFig: 4.2 \\nBut,  v2 = u2 + 2as \\nor, as = v2\\n2 ; [since, initial velocity, u = 0]  \\n∴ Ek =   1\\n2  mv2                                                                                            … … …  (4.2) \\n∴ Kinetic energy = 1\\n2 × mass × (velocity)2 \\nKinetic energy depends on the mass of object. The more is the mass the higher is the \\nkinetic energy. With the same velocity a light tennis ball and a heavy cricket ball are \\nthrown at you.

When the stone or brick was in rest on the roof potential energy was stored in it but the potential energy works when it falls down. The energy was stored in \\nthe stone because it was above the ground.  \\nWhat will happen when the two ends of a spring is stretched and tied to two objects and \\nthen released? The objects will move fast and collide with each other. The stretched \\nspring was at rest but potential energy was there in it. If it is released it may work. The \\nenergy was stored in the stretched spring because it was strained. \\nThe ability of a body to do work when its nor mal position or configuration is changed to \\nsome other position or configuration is called potential energy. \\nExpanded Activities: Take a pulley and place a rope on it. Tie \\na heavy object A with its one end and a light object B with the \\nother end. Such that, A remains above the ground but B \\nremains on the ground [Fig: 4.3]. Remove your hand.  \\nWhat did you see? The object A goes down and object B goes up. \\nThe potential energy was stored in the object A as it was above the ground from its normal position and \\ngained ability to work. It can \\nwork till it reaches the ground that is it can raise the object B.  \\nExperiment:  Take a spring and tie its one end with a strong support and a block to its other \\nend. Place them on a smooth surface. Now apply force on the block and contract the spring and \\nkeep another object in front of the block [Fig: 4.4] then remove your hand. \\nWhy did the object move fast? Spring could work while regaining its original \\nconfiguration and was able to displace the other body. This ability of spring to work for the change of its normal configuration is its potential energy. If some work is done against the force at the time of changing from normal position or configuration to some other position or configuration then the body obtains the capacity of doing work that is same amount of energy is stored in it. This principle is applicable within the sphere of in fluence of conservative force such \\nas electric force, magnetic force, spring force etc. This sphere of influence is called the field of that force such as gravitational field, electric field etc. We work against the force of gravity when we lift anything higher from the ground. As a result the object obtains some amount of potential energy. It can perform the same amount of work \\nwhen it falls on the ground. \\nIf a body of mass m is raised to a height h (fig:4.5) above the surface of the earth, the \\nwork done in such a process is a measure of potential energy stored in the body.

Work is \\navailable at the expense of energy. Uninterrupted energy supply is essential for the \\nsurvival of all living creatures. The demand of energy is increasing day by day with the development of life style. For this increasing demand of energy man is looking for newer \\nsources of energy. We need to have clear idea about the sources of energy to save the \\nliving beings and to continue the supply of energy. We know that the sun is the only source of all energy. Moreover, the nuclear energy in the nucleus and the energy from \\nthe hot melted substances are considered to  be the sources of energy. All the existing \\nenergy of the world is directly or indirectly comes from the sun or are produced using \\nthe radiation of the sun.  \\nChemical Energy/Fuel Energy: \\nMan in the ancient time was dependent wholly on the energy of their muscles. \\nAfterwards, they learnt to tame the wild animals and use their energy in different work. They used to carry their goods and cultivate la nd with the help of animals. The initial \\nstage of civilization was to produce heat energy from burning wood and leaves and \\nmechanical energy from current of water and flow of wind. The economic development of human being begins from the use of machine energy. Industrial revolution and \\ninvention of steam engine reduced men’s dependence on muscle energy of human and \\nanimals. Man kept operating different machines with the help of steam energy.

So we consider different kinds of fuels to be the \\nsources of energy. \\nThe most common sources of energy are coal, mineral oil and natural gas. Coal, mineral \\noil and natural gas from underground are used as fuel directly or by refining them \\nslightly. \\nCoal :  \\nCoal is best known to us as one of the sources of energy. It is an organic substance. Once \\nupon a time there were numerous plants and trees. Due to different natural calamities \\nand natural consequences the leaves of the trees and their stems were buried underneath the earth and began to coagulate. As a result of chemical changes, the leaves of the trees \\nand stems were transformed into coal. Combusti on of coal gives us heat directly. This is \\na well known fuel. Many essential substances can be produced from coal apart from using it as a fuel. Some of the coal products are coal gas, tar, benzene, ammonia, toluene \\netc. Coal is used to cook food and to drive the steam engines. In modern age, the main \\nuse of coal is in thermal power plants. The main fuel in a thermal power station is coal. \\nThe main problem of a coal fueled power station is that it emits sulphur smog which \\ncauses acid rain. Though this acid is very weak, it kills the fishes of pond, cannel and lake, destroys forest and damages the sculptures of stone.   \\nMineral Oil: \\nPetroleum or mineral oil is one of the principal sources of energy. It is widely used as a fuel in the present world. It is being used right from a rural cottage to the most modern \\ntransport system. Petrol, pitch that is used  to pave roads, kerosene and chemical \\nfertilizers are all petroleum products. There is nothing like petrol to be used as fuel. On the other hand, many kinds of artificial fabrics can be developed from petroleum. These \\nare terry line, polyester, cashmilon etc. Mo reover, various types of cosmetics are \\nproduced from petroleum. But it is basically us ed as a fuel. Petroleum products are used \\nto produce electric and mechanical energy. Petroleum is a Latin word. It is a \\ncombination of two minor words: Petro and Olium. In Latin language ‘petro’ means \\nstone and ‘olium’ means oil. So, petroleum means oil of stones i.e. oil stored inside stones. In tertiary age i.e. almost five to si x crores of years ago the trees and the animals \\nfell buried in the different layers of sedimentary rock on the bottom of the sea. Due to \\ndifferent chemical changes these were transformed into mineral oil. Most of the solid \\nregions of the present world were a part of the bottom region of the sea in prehistoric age.  \\nNatural Gas: \\nNatural gas is a well known source of energy. Specially, the use of natural gas in \\nBangladesh is wider. Use of natural gas is very high in all advanced countries. It is also used in different industries as fuel. In Bangladesh it is widely used for domestic \\nrequirement basically for cooking purposes. It is  also used in fertilizer factories. Heat \\nenergy is produced by the combustion of gas and electric energy is produced from heat \\nenergy in a thermal power station. \\nNatural gas is obtained from underneath the earth. Digging very deep well the gas may \\nbe taken out from underneath the earth. Tremendous temperature and pressure inside the \\nearth is the root cause of the creation of the gas. Natural gas is also available in '),\n",

The principal element in a natural gas is the methane gas. These are \\ncalled fossil energy. \\nThe three sources of energy discussed above are reducing very fast due to the men’s \\nincreasing demand of energy. The physical condition of the world is such that these \\nsources-coal, mineral oil, natural gas cannot be recreated, these are called nonrenewable energy. So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy \\nfrom water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc \\nare the main sources. These sources are direc tly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As \\nlong as earth receives sunlight the energy su pply from these sources is possible. These \\nare called renewable sources.     \\nSolar Energy: \\nThe energy that we obtain from the sun is called Solar Energy. It is known to all that the \\nsun is the source of all energy. The origin of all forms of energy is from the solar energy in one way or the other. For an example, the fossil fuel such as coal, mineral, oil, and natural gas is actually a store of solar energy for a long time. \\nFrom ancient times man is using sunlight di rectly to dry things. At present man is \\nadopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun’s rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a \\nmetallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected. The cooker can be used in cooking \\npurposes.  \\nDo it yourself:  Take a concave mirror with a focal length of 15cm or 20cm. Hold the mirror \\nfacing the sun. Take a piece of paper and concen trate the sunlight with the help of the mirror \\non it. Hold the mirror till the paper ignites. \\nThe solar rays are used to keep the dwelling houses warm in cold countries. Solar energy \\nis used for drying purposes of crops, fish, vegetables etc. Dried fish can be preserved for \\nmany days. More examples of solar energy are- solar water heater, solar cooker etc. \\nSolar cell has been made by using modern technology. The characteristics of a solar cell \\nare that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are \\nvarious uses of solar cell. \\n1.  This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the \\nartificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time.  \\n2. Solar energy is being used to operate different electronic devices like pocket \\ncalculator, pocket radio and electronic watch.       \\n3.  Currently electrical energy is produced from solar energy in the rural area, houses or \\noffices to meet up the need of electricity.  \\nThe advantage of solar energy is that it does not pollute the environment. There is almost no possibility of danger in using this energy. There is also no possibility of sudden \\nexhaustion of solar energy. This is why it is likely to be used as a prospective fuel \\ninstead of fossil fuel.      \\nHydroelectricity (Transformation of mechanical energy): \\nWater is one of the renewable sources of energy. Energy can be produced by means of \\nwater current and tide and ebb. There are different forms of energy in the water current '),\n",

Electricity produced by means of water current is \\nknown as hydroelectricity. Different countries of the world make use of potential energy \\nfor producing electricity in hydroelectric projects. The method of producing \\nhydroelectricity using the water current is simple. The current of water is used to rotate a turbine. A co-ordination of mechanical and magnetic energy is possible from the rotation \\nof turbines.  \\nElectricity produced   by mechanical energy created by water current in co-ordination of \\nmagnetic energy is called hydroelectricity.  \\nMaking a model: Make a model of a \\nhydroelectric station that uses the energy of \\nfalling water to turn a turbine to operate a \\ndynamo to produce hydroelectricity. [Fig: 4.6]  \\n \\nPotential energy is used to produce electricity in \\nthe Kaptai electricity production station of our country.  \\nMan is trying to use the energy of tide and ebb \\nof river or ocean for a long time. The operation of different machines using the energy of tide and ebb has been invented a long time ago.  \\nIn France electric energy production projects are being successfully implemented using \\nthe energy of tide and ebb. Other countries of the world are also trying to set up tidal energy projects to produce electricity.  \\nWind Energy \\nWind flows due to the difference of temperature in the earth surface. Kinetic energy due \\nto the air flow can be transferred into electric energy. The machine that transforms energy is called Windmill. People in the ancient time used to lift water from well, sail \\nship using the wind blow. Still today people sail in the boat using air energy. Nowadays \\nelectric energy is produced using windmill with the help of technology. \\nGeo-Thermal Energy \\nThe heat in the earth can be used as the source of energy. The heat in the deep of earth is \\nso high that it can melt pieces of rocks. This melted rock is called Magma. This Magma \\nsometimes rises up and remains stored just below the surface of the ground due to \\ngeological changes. These types of places ar e known as hot spot. When the water under \\nthe ground comes in contact with the hot spot it turns into steam which remains stored in \\nthe ground. This steam could be let out passing a pipe through a hole on the hot spot \\nwith the help of high pressure. Electricity can be produced rotating a turbine with the \\nhelp of this steam. There is such kind of power station in Newzealand.          \\nBiomass Energy \\nA small fraction of solar energy is transformed into chemical energy by the green plants \\nin the process of photosynthesis and remains st ored as biomass in different parts of the \\n \\nFigure: 4.6 '),\n",

Biomass refers to all those organic materials that can transform into energy. Man \\nalong with other animals takes biomass as food and keeps their activities of life active by \\ntransforming biomass into energy. Biomass can be considered as a multiple source of \\nenergy. The organic substances that can be us ed as the source of energy are – plants and \\ntrees, dry wood, waste of wood, crops, husk of rice, herbs, waste of birds and animals, \\ngarbage etc. Biomass is mainly composed of Carbon and Hydrogen. One of the \\nrenewable sources of energy is biomass. \\nBiogas can be produced easily from biomass. We can use this gas as the alternate to \\nnatural gas and use for cooking even for the production of electricity. The production of \\nbiogas is very simple. If we keep cow dung and water in 1:2 ratio in a closed pot for \\ndumping, biogas will be produced. This gas comes out through a tube. This gas is used for cooking. For the cooking and lighting bulbs for a family of 4/5 persons the requirement of gas can be supplied from the cow dung of only 2/3 cows. \\nNuclear energy \\nElectricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction. The \\nnuclear reaction from which the obtained energy is used to produce electricity is called nuclear fission. Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor. \\nIn nuclear reaction usually matter that is mass is transformed into energy. But in nuclear \\nreaction only a small fraction of energy of th e total mass is transformed into energy. If \\nmass is transformed and E amount of energy is obtained, then, \\nE = mc\\n2 \\nHere m is the mass transformed into energy. c is the speed of light that is equal to 3 x 10\\n8 ms-1. \\nFrom experiment it is known that in a fission reaction, that is, if a neutron of definite \\nenergy strikes a uranium nucleus, then almost  \\n200 Mev = 200 x 106 ev = 200 x 106 x 1.6 x 10-19 J = 3.2 x 10-11 J energy is released. \\nSince nuclear fission is a chain reaction, hence in a moment crores of reactions take \\nplace and huge amount of energy is released. \\nCalculate:  If a substance of 1kg mass is converted completely into energy, then how many \\nkilowatt energy will be produced? 1 kilowatt-hour (1 kWh) = 3.6 x 106 J \\nThe energy obtained from this reaction can be transferred to another container as the \\ninternal energy of carbon dioxide, by pumping continuously at high pressure in a controlled way. This heated gas moves around a special steam boiler and heats the steam \\ninside which can rotate a turbine and produce electricity. The amount of energy obtained \\nfrom a ton of uranium by a nuclear reaction will be equal to the amount of energy \\nobtained from burning ten lac tons of coal. \\nBut there are some problems of nuclear power plants. The waste of nuclear fuel is \\nextremely radioactive and so it has to be preserved for thousands of years to make it \\nsafe. Moreover, in a nuclear reactor high temp erature and pressure is produced. So it has \\nto be made of such a material that can tolerate the high temperature and pressure. Any \\nnuclear accident is very dangerous which we can realize from the accidents of Chernobyl '),\n",

In nuclear power \\nproduction less greenhouse gas is released in the environment.  \\nThe Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy \\nUses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life. In comparison \\nwith the demand of our country the storage of coal, petroleum and natural gas is very \\npoor. So, we have to import mineral oil and coal from abroad to meet up the demand of energy by spending a lot of valuable foreign currency. But utilizing the renewable \\nenergy sources that we have in our country especially if we can encourage the people to \\nproduce and use biogas, we will be able to change the infrastructure of rural area. We can focus our attention to electricity production using windmill.  If we can make the use \\nof solar energy available through research, we will be able to meet up all our demands of \\nenergy from this unlimited source.  \\nThe main advantage of using of renewable energy is that there is no possibility of \\ndiminishing of energy. Moreover it will be possible to protect our country from environment pollution.         \\n4.4 Transformation of energy  \\nEnergy is being transformed continuously from one form to another. Various incidents \\nare taking place in this universe due to transformation of energy. Though energy is transforming from one form to more than one form, the total amount of energy in this universe remains unchanged.  \\nTransformation of energy is required for man, computer or any other machine to work or \\nto make any change or to process anything. One form of energy can be used to produce another different form of energy. Actually, one form of energy is simultaneously \\ntransforming into another form which is known as the transformation of energy. What \\nhappens when anyone plays guitar? The musc le energy of the artist transforms into \\nmechanical energy on the vibrating string which transforms into sound energy as a \\nmelodious music and travels to our ears. When wood is burned chemical energy is \\nreleased and transforms into heat and light energy. A chemical reaction takes place in an electric cell and the chemical energy of these reactions transforms into electric energy which is used for various purposes.  \\nWhen a definite amount of energy of a particular form is transformed how much energy \\nis obtained? It can be known from the law of conservation of energy. \\nWhen such a transformation takes place there is no net loss of energy. The energy lost by \\none body is exactly equal to the energy gained by another body. \\nIn fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the \\nuniverse does neither increase nor decrease. The amount of energy that existed in the \\nuniverse at the moment of its creation exis ts till today. This known as conservation of \\nenergy. \\nPrinciple of Conservation of Energy: \\nEnergy can be transformed form one form to another or more forms. The total energy of \\nthe universe is constant and unchangeable. '),\n",

All of them are related to \\none another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. \\nThis is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon \\ncan be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy \\ntransformation are described below. \\n1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: \\nRubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat \\nenergy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound \\nenergy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into \\nkinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way \\nmechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy.  \\n2. Transformation of heat Energy:   \\nIn steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is \\nconverted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by \\nconducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different \\nmetallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. \\n3. Transformation of light energy:   \\nIf we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is \\nconverted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy \\ninto electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is \\ntransformed into chemical energy. \\n4. Transformation of chemical energy:   \\nFood and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The \\nenergy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this \\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or \\nboiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. \\n5. Transformation of electrical energy: \\nIn electric motor electric energy is transfor med into mechanical energy. In instruments \\nlike heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio \\nconverts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is \\nconverted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into \\nmagnetic energy.  \\n6. Transformation of Nuclear energy:   \\nIn nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy.  \\nDevastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy.  \\nNowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially \\nelectrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy.

By burning coal and \\nnatural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is \\nconverted into mechanical energy with the help  of turbine which rotates the coil of electric \\ngenerator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses \\nand factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. \\nAgain, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward \\nwhich is stored as potential energy due to th e higher position of it. When it moves down the \\npotential energy stored is transformed into kine tic energy. This kinetic energy is used to \\npierce the nail into wood. At the same time s ound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and \\nin hammer is produced.  \\nDuring the transformation energy may not be cr eated or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we \\ncannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy.  \\n4.5 Power \\nWe all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking \\ndecision and implementation. In science the word  “power” is related to the devices motor, \\npump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can  work. Sometimes we want to solve any task \\nquickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking \\nwater from its reservoir at the ground floor or fro m a pond. It takes a lo t of time if we want \\nto fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of \\na motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a sour ce can work is measured. Suppose two friends-\\nRoni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. \\nComing to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5\\nth \\nfloor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount \\nof work to reach the same height Roni has mo re power because he has done the work faster. \\nPower is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Po wer of a person or a source is \\nmeasured by the amount of work done per unit time. \\nPower = Work\\nTime  \\nIf as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the \\npower P will be, P =                    (4.4) \\nPower has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. \\nDimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of              . \\nPower = Work\\nTime  = Force x Displacement\\nTime = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement\\nTime  \\n= Mass x Displacement x Displacement\\n Time x Time2    = Mass x Displacement2\\n Time3      \\n∴ [P] = ML2\\nT3  = [ML2T-3] W \\nt \\nWork \\nTime '),\n",

Since \\nthe unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be \\nJoule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. \\nIf one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called \\none watt. \\n1W = 1J\\n1S  = 1 Js-1  \\nSince watt is very smaller, its thousan d times larger unit kilo-watt is used. \\n1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word “Horse Power”. This unit of power was used earlier. \\nStill today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. \\n1 Horse Power = 746 watt \\nHave you heard the word “kilowatt-hour”? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of \\nwork or energy. We usually pay the bill of el ectricity of houses, factories etc measured \\nin this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules \\nelectrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. \\n200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 \\njoules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. \\nMathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm \\nheight each in 15 s. What is his power?  \\n(g = 9.8 ms\\n-2) \\nWe know, \\nP=                 =    =  \\n  = 343 W \\nAns: 343 W \\nDo it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach  the roof of your school or house or any \\nother building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a \\nweight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your \\nweight in newton. Then run to the top of the ro of. Measure the total time  of reaching the roof \\nwith the help of a stop watch. \\nYour work done will be, your weight × total height \\nYour power will be, your total work done ÷ total time i.e.,      . \\nPerform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them.

For example we run \\nan engine by transforming chemical energy stored in petrol into kinetic energy. According to the principle of conservation of energy, we should obtain the amount of energy which is given to the engine. But it is seen that the energy gained is always less \\nthan the energy given to. This is because some energy is lost due to the work done against the frictional force of the engine. The amount of energy obtained from the engine is called effective energy. In this  case the equation of energy is, \\nGiven energy = Effective energy + the energy lost in other ways \\nThe efficiency of an engine means that how much of the given energy is obtained as \\neffective energy. So, the efficiency means the ratio of effective energy and the total given energy. Usually the efficiency is expressed in percentage. \\n∴ efficiency, η =    × 100% \\nEnergy transformation takes place in different steps in a normal electricity production \\ncentre. This transformation continues from coal, oil, natural gas or Uranium up to the production of electricity. It is seen that up to 70% of this energy is lost as heat energy. \\nAt last only the 30% of input energy is transformed into useable electrical energy. So, \\nwe can say the efficiency of the electricity production centre is 30%. \\nMathematical Example 4.5: An electric motor is used to lift a body of weight 10N at a \\nheight 5m. It uses electrical energy of 65J. \\na) What is the energy lost by the motor? \\nb) Find the efficiency of the motor. \\nAns: \\na) Here, energy used = work done \\n      = Force x displacement \\n      = Weight x height       = 10N x 5m \\n      = 50J \\n∴ The energy lost = Energy supplied – energy used \\n                                  = 65J – 50J \\n                                  = 15J \\nb) Efficiency, η =                                 x 100% \\n =          x 100%  \\n = 76.92% \\n Effective energy \\nTotal input energy \\nEffective energy \\nTotal input energy \\n50J \\n65J '),\n",

The shoes \\npierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so \\nwearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure.  \\n \\nFig-5.1 \\nThe force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F \\nact perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F\\nA                                          \\ni.e.   Pressure = Force\\nArea   \\nIt is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the \\npressure P. \\nExample: \\n(i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is \\nplaced on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail,   comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end  as a result the nail easily enters into the \\nsubstance.  \\n(ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of \\nthe knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance \\nalong edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut.  \\nDo it yourself:  Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? \\nExplain. \\nMore pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. \\nWhen force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece \\nof iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its materi al. Density is a general property of matter. \\nDensity of a body depends on its material and temperature.  \\nDensity is denoted by ρ.

Fill \\nthe whole tube with pure mercury. Close the open end of the tube tightly with finger and invert the tube. Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container.  This pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column of the tube. In absence of this pressure th e mercury of the tube will come down due to \\nthe force of gravity. Therefore, atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the mercury column of the tube. Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured.  \\nThe space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is \\ntotally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli’s vacuum. Only a scarce amount \\nof mercury vapor exists there. The apparatus used to measure the air pressure is called \\nbarometer. \\n5.4: Altitude and atmospheric pressure  \\nThe atmospheric pressure depends on the density and \\nheight of the atmosphere. On the earth’s surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases. So, the air pressure reduces with the increase of height. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. For this reason respiration becomes difficult at such a high level. There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressu re is considerably low there. Nowadays \\nnormal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earth’s surface the pressure of the atmosphere  decreases. The change of pressure of the \\natmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4].  \\n5.5 Change in atmospheric pressure and weather With the change of time the atmospheric pressure of a certain place also changes. The \\nvariation of water vapor in air is the cause of this change. The density of air also changes \\nFigur: 5.3 \\nFigur: 5.4 Torricelli’s \\nvacuum \\ncm '),\n",

We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure \\nby observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. \\n1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the \\npressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain.   \\n2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the \\natmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. \\n3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it \\nindicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. \\n5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium \\nPressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid. In fig. 5.5 some liquid is kept in a vessel.   \\nLet the area of the base of the vessel = A  \\ndensity of the liquid = \\nρ \\ndepth of the liquid = h \\nacceleration due to gravity = g \\nWe know, pressure = force ÷ area          Now, the force acting on area A  = weight of the liquid  \\n= mass of the liquid × g \\n= volume of the liquid × density × g = area of the base × depth × density × g  \\n= Ah\\nρg  \\nPressure, P = Ah ρg/A \\nor, Pressure, P= h ρg \\nAgain as ‘g’ is a constant, so P ∝ hρ \\ni.e. the pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium is directly \\nproportional to the depth of that point from the free surface of the liquid and its density. Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6). \\nMathematical Example 5.3 : A vessel contains kerosene.

Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. \\nPressure of a fluid:  The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a \\nsurface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = \\nF/A. \\nBuoyancy:  A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it \\nis not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it.  \\nTherefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the \\nweight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight.  \\nMagnitude of buoyancy:  \\nEvery point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density  ρ. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface \\nof the fluid are h\\n1 and h 2 respectively.  \\nSo, h = h 2 – h 1 \\nThe downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah 1ρg \\nThe upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah 2ρg \\nThe lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \\n∴ Upward thrust or buoyancy  \\n= F\\n2 – F 1  \\n= Ah 2ρg – Ah 1ρg \\n= A (h 2 – h 1) ρg \\n= Ah ρg. \\n= (hA) ρg \\n= Vρg [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] \\n= weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. \\nSo, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of \\nthe fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight.    Figur: 5.7 '),\n",

The weight of the body, W1 acts vertically downwards. \\n2.  The buoyancy W2 acts vertically upward on an immersed \\nbody. There are three conditions of floatation and immersion \\nof a body-        \\na)  If W1> W2, i.e. when the weight of the body is greater than \\nthe buoyancy of the liquid the body sinks.  \\nIn this case the weight of the body is more than the weight of \\nthe displaced liquid. \\nb)  If W1=W 2 i.e. when the weight of the body equals to the buoyancy of the liquid the \\nbody floats being fully immersed in liquid. In such situation the weight of the body \\nis equal to the weight of the liquid displaced. \\nc)  If W1<W2 i.e. the weight of the body is less than the buoyancy of the liquid, the body \\ndoes not sink. It floats being partly immersed in liquid. In such a position the weight \\nof the body is less than the displaced water. \\n5.9 : Archimedes Law:  \\nFrom the experience of our daily life we observe that any solid \\nsubstance when immersed in liquid it appears lighter. Its cause is on an immersing body vertically upward force or buoyancy acts \\non it.  \\nBefore 300 B.C. the Greek philosopher Archimedes invented that \\nif a body is partly or fully immersed in a liquid or gas in \\nequilibrium, it seems to have lost a part of its weight. This apparent loss of weight is \\nequal to the weight of the displaced liquid or gas.  \\nExperiment:  Take a body of known weight. Tie the body by a light thread and dip it into a \\ncontainer completely filled with water. Some water will spill out of the vessel. Take the \\nweight of the body in completely submersed condition. Now find out the apparent loss of \\nweight by subtracting the weight of the body immersed in water from the known weight of the \\nbody in air. Now determine the weight of the spilled out water. It will be observed that the \\napparent loss of weight of the body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. Thus we \\nmay have a proof of Archimedes’ principle in a simple way.      \\n \\nCalculate : The surface area of the bottom of a rectangular block is 25cm2. It is dipped in \\nwater. Density of water is 1000kgm-3. The depth of the upper surface of the block from the \\nopen surface of the water is 5cm. If the height of the block is 2cm, then  \\n1. Find the water pressure P 1 on the upper surface of the block   \\n2. Calculate the pressure P 2 at the bottom of the block  \\n3.

When a ship is made, its \\nsize and shape both are made in such a way that at the floating state the weight of the \\nwater displaced by the immersed part of the body is equal to the weight of the ship. \\nNow as more passengers get onboard, the more of its weight increases and it keeps \\nimmersing into water. When more passengers than its capacity get on the ship, it sinks. \\nAccording to weather signals a ship will have to sail carefully taking less number of passengers than its capacity as current and waves are there in the river. Due to defective \\ndesign of the ship its centre of mass ch anges and becomes the cause of accident. One \\nshould not get onboard being an excess passenger.  \\n5.10: Pascal’s Law \\nIf pressure is applied on any point of an encl osed liquid or gas it is transmitted in all \\ndirections. Pascal stated a law about this transmission of pressure.  \\nPascal’s law:  External pressure applied to any portion of a liquid or a gas enclosed in a \\ncontainer is equally transmitted in all directions in the liquid or the gas without any trace \\nof diminution and acts perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or gas. \\nMathematical explanation of Pascal’s la w: principle of multiplications of force \\nOn any portion of a confined liquid if force is applied by a smaller piston, then forces of greater magnitudes are \\nexerted on the pistons of greater cross sectional area. \\nThis is known as principle of multiplication of force. \\nLet, C\\n1 and C 2 be two cylinders (Fig:5.10) and A 1 \\nand A 2 be their cross sectional areas respectively. The \\ntwo cylinders are connected by a pipe. There is an air tight piston in each cylinder. The two cylinders are filled up with a liquid. Now a force F applied to the smaller piston \\ngenerates a pressure F\\n1/A1. According to Pascal’s law this pressure is transmitted in all \\ndirections through the liquid. Therefore the upward pressure exerted on the larger piston is F\\n1/A1. Because of this pressure, the larger piston experiences an upward force equal to \\n(F1/A1) × A 2. If the upward force of larger piston is F 2, \\nthen F2  =   F1\\nA1 × A 2   \\n     ∴    F2\\nF1   = A2\\nA1                              (5.4) \\nSo, greater is the cross sectional area of the larger piston, the greater is the force exerted \\non it. If the cross sectional area of the larger one is 100 times greater than that of the \\nsmaller one, then a force of 1N applied to the smaller one will produce an upward force \\nof 100N on the larger piston.

As soon as the tape is released of the tension it regains its original length or tends \\nto get back its previous length. Here pull means application of force and elongation in length means deformation. Actually as deformation of a body occurs, a resistive force \\ngenerates within the body for which it tends to get back its original size and shape. \\nElasticity is defined as the attributed property by which a body is able to resist \\ndeformation, either in shape or in volume or both and recovers its original shape and size \\nwhen the deforming force is removed. The substances which possess this property are \\ncalled elastic substances. There is a certain li mit of the deforming force and if the force \\napplied exceeds the limit the body then unable to regain its previous shape and size. This \\nlimit of applied force is termed as elastic limit. \\nThe molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied \\non elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to \\nthis applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object \\nis called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into \\nplay to resist the applied external force. This developed internal restoring force acting \\nperpendicularly per unit area of the body is called strain.  \\nHooke’s law:  Scientist Robert Hooke invented the basic law of elasticity. According to \\nthis law- within elastic limit stress is directly proportional to strain.  \\nMathematically we may write, stress ∝ strain  \\n∴ stress = constant × strain. \\nThis constant is called the modulus of elasticity of the material of the body. Strain has no \\nunit. The unit of stress is Nm\\n-2. The unit of modulus of elasticity is also Nm-2. \\n5.12. Molecular kinetic theory of matter  \\nThe basic conception of the molecular kinetic \\ntheory of matter is to consider that the molecules of a matter are in motion. The kinetic theory of \\nmatter is based on the following postulates:  \\n1. Any substance consists of innumerable \\nnumber of minute particles. These particles are called molecules. \\n2. The molecules are so small that they are considered as points. \\n3. The molecules of a substance are always in motion.  \\n4. The gaseous molecules remain at a considerable distance. For this reason almost no \\nforce of attraction and repulsion act between them. Though the liquid molecules remain at some distance, force of attraction between them prevails.

In solid \\nsubstances the particles remain very close to each other and very strong attractive \\nforce exists in them which give the solid substance a definite size and volume. \\n5. The molecules move at random in liquid and gas. So, these molecules collide among \\nthemselves and also on the surface of the walls of the container.  \\n5.13. Plasma state of matter The forth state of matter is called plasma state. This plasma is the ionized gas at very \\nhigh temperature. The main source of plasma is the Sun. Except this the other stars are \\nalso the sources of plasma. The plasma stat e is formed at a few thousand degrees of \\ntemperature. Plasma has no definite shape and volume like gases.

Heat flows \\nfrom hotter to colder bodies. Therefore th e energy that transfers from one body to \\nanother due to the difference of temperature is called heat. \\nThe molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they \\npossess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the mo lecules constituting the substance. When heat \\nis applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases.  \\nUnit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be \\ncalorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. \\n \\nTask: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take \\nwater at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix \\nsome amount of hot water and water at room temperature in \\nthe container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands?  \\n \\nWater at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right \\nhand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. \\nTemperature \\nTemperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body \\nwill receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. \\nTemperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid \\nflows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position.

The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as  \\n273 K. 1\\n273.16  th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K.  \\n6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: \\nSpecial properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical \\nproperties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that \\nphysical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it \\nis called the thermometric property of that s ubstance. Thermometric substances are used \\nin thermometers.  \\nThermometric properties of substances are – volume, resistance and pressure etc. In \\nmercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. \\nSimilarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant \\nvolume is termed as thermometric substan ce and the pressure of the gas is called \\nthermometric property. \\n6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: \\nA scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two \\ndefinite temperatures are taken as constant  to prepare a temperature scale. These two \\ntemperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the \\nupper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as \\nfreezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which \\npure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The \\ntemperature difference between the two fixed points is \\ncalled the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space  \\n\\\\in between the two fixed points is divided in different \\nways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use – Celsius, \\nFahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of \\nthese three scales are °C, °F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0°C, in Fahrenheit \\nscale 32°F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper \\nfixed point in Celsius scale is 100°C, in Fahrenheit scale 212°F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.  \\nFig: 6.3 P '),\n",

Three more thermometers graduated in Celsius, Fahrenheit and \\nKelvin scale are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in \\nother three scales are C, F and K respectively.  Therefore the readings of distance PA in \\nthese three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively. Since PA\\nBA is a constant it can be \\nwritten, PA\\nBA = C-0\\n100-0  = F-32\\n212-32 = K-273\\n373-273  \\nor, C\\n100 = F-32\\n180 = K-273\\n100  \\nor, C\\n5  = F-32\\n9 = K-273\\n5                      (6.1) \\nEquation (6.1) indicates the relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. \\nThe convenient relation between Celsius and Kelvin scale is – by adding 273 to Celsius \\nscale reading the Kelvin scale reading can be obtained. For example, 1°C temperature = (1+273) K = 274 K temperature. But if the temperature difference is 1K, then it is equal \\nto 1°C.  \\n Mathematical example 6.1: The temperature of body of a healthy man is 98.4°F. What \\nwould be the reading in Celsius scale? \\nWe know,  \\nC\\n5 =  F-32\\n9  \\nor, C\\n5 = 98.4-32\\n9  \\nor, C = 36.89 °C \\nAns: 36.89 °C \\n6.4 Raise of temperature and internal energy of body: \\nOn the basis of molecular kinetic theory of substances we know that the molecules of a \\nsubstance always remain in motion. The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. \\nThe molecules of liquids and gases move at  random in different directions. Kinetic \\nenergy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion \\nforces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation \\nof potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of \\nthe molecules of a substance is called its intern al energy. Evidently a part of the internal \\nenergy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the \\nkinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Given, \\nTemperature in Fahrenheit scale, F \\n= 98.4°F Temperature in Celsius scale, C = ? '),\n",

When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecule s relative to their equilibrium position \\nincreases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the \\ncase of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less \\nin liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. \\n6.6 Expansion of solids: \\nWith the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. \\nLinear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: \\nWhen heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a \\ndefinite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. \\nLet the length of a bar at  θ\\n1 temperature be l 1 and at θ2 temperature the length be l 2. \\nIncrease in length = l2 – l1 \\nAnd increase of temperature =  θ2 -  θ1 \\nThe coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by α and it can be expressed as, \\n α =            … … … (6.2)  \\n \\n = \\n In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and \\nincrease of temperature, θ2 - θ1 = 1K, then  \\nα = l 2 – l 1 = increase in length.  \\nl2 - l1 \\nl1(θ2 - θ1) \\nIncrease in length \\nInitial length x increase of temperature\\nFig: 6.4 '),\n",

If its length \\nbecomes 100.033m at 50°C, then determine the coefficient of linear expansion of steel. \\nWe know, Coefficient of linear expansion, \\nα =  \\n \\n     =         = 11\\n10-6 K-1 \\n \\nObservation:  Why a gap is kept at the joining point of two rails of a rail line? \\nThe rails expand due to heat of the sun or due to heat produced by \\nfriction between the wheels and rails while the train runs. For this \\nexpansion sufficient space is kept between the two rails. If gaps \\nbetween the rails are not kept, the rail line will bend due to its expansion. \\nSuperficial expansion and coefficient of superficial expansion: \\nThe area of a solid  is increased with  the increase of temperature. It is \\ncalled superficial expansion.  \\nLet initial surface area of a solid at \\nθ1 temperature = A1 \\nWhen the temperature is increased to θ2 the final surface area = A2  \\n Increase in temperature = θ2 - θ1 \\nAnd increase in area = A2 – A 1 \\nThe coefficient of superficial expansion is expressed by the symbol β \\n ∴ Superficial expansion , β =                              … … … (6.3) \\n                                                \\n                                             =    \\nIn equation 6.3 if the surface area A 1 = 1m2 and the increase of temperature ( θ2 - θ1) = \\n1K is considered, then the increase in surface area β = A 2-A1=increase in surface area. \\nSo, the increase in surface area of 1m2 surface area of a solid for the rise of temperature \\n1K is called the coefficient of superficial expansion of the material of that solid.

It is called volume expansion. \\nLet, the initial volume of a substance be V1 and initial temperature \\nbe θ1. When the temperature is raised to  θ2, its volume becomes V2 \\nafter being increased. There increase in volume is V2 – V 1 and \\nincrease of temperature = θ2 - θ1. \\nNow if the coefficient of volume expansion is represented by γ, then  \\nγ =                                 … … … (6.4) \\n \\n   =  \\nIn equation 6.4 if the initial volume V1 = 1m3 and increase of temperature, θ2 - θ1 = 1K, \\nthen  \\nγ = V 2 – V 1 = increase in volume. \\nTherefore, the increase in volume of a solid of volume 1m3 for a rise of temperature 1K \\nis called the coefficient of volume expansion of the material of the solid.  \\nThe coefficient of volume expansion of copper is 50.1 \\n  10-6 m3 means that if the \\ntemperature of a copper body with a volume of 1m3 increases through 1K then its \\nvolume will increase by 50.1 \\n  10-6 m3. \\nThe relations among  α, β and γ are as follow: \\nγ = 3α and β = 2α \\n6.7 Expansion of liquids: \\nLiquids have no definite length or area. But it has definite volume. If the temperature is \\nincreased its volume increases. So, the expansion of liquid means the expansion in volume of the liquid. The rates of increase in volume of all the liquids are not the same. Different liquids having the same volume expand differently for the same rise of temperature. \\nExperiment: \\nA number of long necked glass bulbs of equal volume and \\nsize are taken. Equal volume of water, alcohol, kerosene, ether etc are taken in these bulbs (fig 6.8). Now water at room temperature is taken in a comparatively larger vessel and the bulbs are placed vertically in it. The upper level of the liquids in all the bulbs will be the same. Now some hot water is poured into the vessel. After some time the bulbs will attain a higher temperature and it will be seen in the stem of the bulbs the upper level of different liquids are not at the same height rather their heights are different. So, it is understood that the volumes of different liquids of same volume expand differently for a definite increase of temperature. \\nV2-V1 \\nV1(θ2-θ1) \\nIncrease in volume \\nInitial volume x increase of temperatureFig: 6.7 \\nFig: 6.8 V1 V2 '),\n",

The liquid as well as the \\ncontainer expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. \\nThere are two types of expansions of liquids- \\na. Real expansion \\nb. Apparent expansion \\nReal expansion: \\nIf it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real \\nexpansion of the liquid that would be obtaine d is called real expansion of the liquid. But \\nheating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by V\\nr. \\nApparent expansion: \\nThe expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the \\ncontainer is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by V a. \\nRelation between real expansion and apparent expansion: \\nA glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now \\nkeeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real \\nexpansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. \\nFrom figure it is observed that, \\nCB = CA+AB \\nor, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container ∴V\\nr = V a + V g … … … (6.5) \\n6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: \\nMatter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas.

These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature. \\nA solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion.

If heat is \\napplied to ice below 0°C, temperature will rise and reach at 0°C. After this if more heat \\nis applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The \\namount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules.  \\nOn further heating the temperature of water of 0°C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts \\nvaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond \\namong the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be \\nconverted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable.        \\n6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: \\nFusion \\nTo transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The \\ndefinite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This \\ntemperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. \\nVaporization \\nThe phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is \\ncalled vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- \\ni) Evaporation \\nii) Boiling \\nEvaporation \\nThe process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface \\ninto vapor state is called evaporation. \\nActivities:  Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your  room. Observe what \\nhappens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. \\nWhat is the cause for the reduction of this water?     \\nThe water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the \\namount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. \\nBoiling \\nThe process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its \\ntemperature through application of heat is called boiling.  \\nThe temperature at which boiling of liquid be gins is called the boiling point of that \\nliquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. \\nExperiment: Pouring  some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of \\ntemperature would be observed. At a certain te mperature the water will begin to boil and get \\nconverted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted \\ninto its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. \\nCondensation: \\nThe process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation.

What do you observe? The pieces of ice have joined together. Why? \\nAs the pressure acts on the surface of contact of the two pieces of \\nice, the melting point goes down  i.e. the melting point becomes \\nless than 0°C. But the temperature of the surface of contact remains at 0°C. So, ice at the surface of contact melts. The required amount of heat needed for melting is collected from the ice. After the removal of pressure the melting point again becomes 0°C. As a result the water obtained from the fusion of ice at the surface of contact again freezes to ice. For this reason if pressure is applied then two pieces of ice unite together to form a single piece.  \\nTo melt a solid substance into liquid by applying pressure and again to bring it back to \\nthe solid state by reducing the pressure is called regelation. \\nThe melting point of a substance changes due to the variation of pressure on the \\nsubstance. The changes of melting point may occur in two different ways for pressure. \\n• The solid substances whose volumes contr act on melting, their melting points reduce \\nwith the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a lower temperature. \\n• The solid substances whose volumes expand on melting, their melting points \\nincrease with the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a higher temperature.     \\n6.12 Latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization \\nLatent heat of fusion:  We know, when the temperature of a solid reaches the melting \\npoint due to application of heat then the temperature remain unchanged until all the substances transform into liquid. Here the amount of heat required to transform the solid into liquid is nothing but latent heat of fusion.  \\nThis heat energy does not change the te mperature but is used to loosen the \\nintermolecular bond of the molecules of the substances. \\nLatent heat of vaporization:  If heat is applied  to a liquid  and its temperature  reaches at \\nthe boiling point then whatever amount of heat is applied the temperature will remain unchanged until all the liquid is converted into vapor state. Here the amount of heat required to convert the liquid into vapor state is called latent heat of vaporization. \\nEvaporation produces cooling: In summer days the water kept in a new earthen pitcher becomes cold. Uncountable \\nnumbers of pores are there on the body of an earthen pitcher. Through these pores water seeps out and evaporates. The needed amount of latent heat is provided by the water of the pitcher and as such the water becomes cold. \\nWater kept in the glass or brass vessel does not become cold. Because the body of this \\nkind of container has no pore and there is no possibility of evaporation. Now explain why do you feel cold when air blows over your sweating body?  \\n'),\n",

Less the \\nboiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum. \\nPressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of \\natmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease \\nof pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum. \\nLiquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature \\nof the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase.  \\nEffect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air  over the liquid surface i.e. the less the \\namount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation. The soaked cloths dry up quickly in winter because air remains dry at that time.    \\n6.14 Thermal Capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a body through 1K is called the \\nheat capacity of that body.

The hands of the watch and the \\nelectric fans are the examples of circular periodic motion. The contraction and expansion of spring is the linear periodic \\nmotion. The time required for a complete oscillation of an \\nobject executing periodic motion is called its time period. \\nOscillatory or harmonic motion: \\nIf a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction for one \\nhalf of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then this motion is called oscillatory or harmonic motion. If any \\nspring is hung from a strong support and an object is attached at the \\nlower end and released after stretching, the spring will vibrate up and down. This type of motion is known as oscillatory or harmonic or \\nvibratory motion. Motion of a simple pendulum and motion of a \\nvibrating tuning fork is harmonic motion.  \\n7.2 Waves \\nA stone is thrown on the still water of the pond. When the stone hits the water then the \\nparticles of water of that region start to vibrate. These vibrating particles vibrate the neighboring of particles. Thus the vibration reaches to the edge of the pond by vibrating \\nthe particles of water. The particles of water oscillate up and down but do not move \\nforward. The periodic vibration that passes over the surface of water due to the oscillatory motion of the particles is called wave. The mechanical energy produced due \\nto the vibration of water particles is transferred from one place to another through \\nvibration. So, energy is transferred from one place to another through wave. \\nThe periodic motion of particles which transfers energy \\nfrom one place to another through a material medium but \\ndoes not displace the particles permanently is called wave. \\nThe wave produced in solid, liquid or gaseous medium is \\ncalled mechanical wave. Water wave, sound wave etc. are \\nmechanical waves. To transfer the mechanical wave elastic medium is needed. There is another type of wave that does \\nnot need any medium to propagate which are called electromagnetic wave. \\nIt is mentionable that we will limit discussion only to the mechanical wave in this \\nchapter. Here the wave means the wave produced in elastic medium.  \\nThe characteristics of waves are the followings: \\n1. The wave is produced due to the harmonic motion of   the particles but the particles \\nare not displaced permanently. \\nFigure: 7.1 \\nFigure: 7.2 \\nFigure: 7.3 '),\n",

A medium is necessary for the propagation of mechanical wave. \\n3. The wave transfers energy from one place to another. \\n4. The velocity of wave depends on the nature of medium. \\n5. The reflection, refraction and superposition occur in case of wave.  \\nClassification of wave: \\nThere are two kinds of wave: \\n1. Transverse wave   2. Longitudinal wave \\nTask:  Take a long rope as in the figure. Attach one end of the rope with a strong support. \\nMove your hand right and left or up and down by holding the other end. \\nA wave will be created in the rope as in the figure 7.4. Observe that the movement or the \\nvibration of the hand is from left to right or from top to \\nbottom but the motion of wave is horizontal. Here the direction of vibration of the particles is perpendicular to the \\ndirection of propagation of wave. This very wave is \\ntransverse wave. So we can say that the wave which moves perpendicularly to the direction of vibration of the particles \\nis called transverse wave. Water wave is an example of transverse wave.  \\n \\nA spring is set as in the figure 7.5. Now let’s move our hand forward and backward by \\nholding the free end of the spring. When we move the hand forward a flow of contraction will be created in the spring. Again if we move the hand backward, a flow of \\nrarefaction will be created in the spring. The flow of contraction and rarefaction \\ncontinues to move forward. In this case the movement of hand and the wave moves in the same direction. That means, the direction of vibration of the spring and the motion of \\nwave are parallel to each other. So we can say that the wave that travels in a direction \\nparallel to the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium is known as \\nlongitudinal wave. The sound wave in the air me dium is an example of longitudinal wave.   \\nThe highest and the lowest point of a transverse wave are called wave \\ncrest and wave trough. The similar quantities in the longitudinal wave \\nare contraction and rarefaction. \\n7.3 Wave related quantities \\nComplete vibration : \\nIf a wave transmitting particle moves from a certain point and again \\ncomes back to the same point then the motion is called complete \\nvibration. \\nFigure: 7.4 \\nFigure: 7.5 \\nFigure: 7.6 down up motion of wave \\nrope \\ndirection of wavedirection of \\nvibration\\ncontraction expansion '),\n",

It is \\nexpressed by the letter T and its unit is second (s). \\n \\nFrequency: \\nThe number of complete vibrations in one second of a wave transmitting particle is \\nknown as its frequency. Wave is produced from a vibrating object. So the frequency of \\nvibrating object is equal to the frequency of the wave. The unit of frequency is Hertz \\n(Hz). If a vibrating particle executes one complete vibration in one second then its \\nfrequency is called 1 Hz. It is expressed by ‘ƒ’.  The relation between frequency and \\ntime period is ƒ =T1 \\nAmplitude:  \\nTo produce a wave the particles need to vibrate about their equilibrium position. The \\nmaximum displacement of a wave transmitti ng particle from the position of equilibrium \\nis called amplitude. In the figure ‘a’ is amplitude. \\n \\nPhase:  \\nThe overall condition of motion of a wave transmitting particle at any moment is known \\nas phase. The overall condition means the displacement, velocity and acceleration etc of \\nthe particle at a certain time. The wave crest or the wave trough always remains in the same phase in case of a transverse wave. \\nIn the figure the particles of points P and P’\\n or R and R’ are in same phase. \\nWavelength:  \\nThe distance between the two successive particles of same phase is called wave length. \\nWave length is defined as the distance through which a wave travels in a time during \\nwhich a wave transmitting particle completes one oscillation. Wave length is expressed \\nby λ. Its unit is meter (m). \\nIn the figure the distance PP’ or RR’ or SS’ is wavelength, λ.  \\nWave velocity: The distance that a wave travels in one second  in a particular direction is called wave \\nvelocity.

Frequency is denoted by ƒ. Again the time period is the time of one \\ncomplete vibration. \\nIf the time period is T, then in T second, the number of vibration is 1 \\nTherefore, the number of vibration in one second is T1\\n  \\nThe number of vibration in 1 second is frequency. So, the frequency, ƒ= 1\\nT                   (7.1) \\nThe relation between wave velocity and wavelength: \\nWe know that number of complete vibrations in one second is called frequency. Again \\nthe distance travelled by the wave during one complete oscillation is called wavelength. \\nSo, if the wavelength is λ,  \\ntherefore, the distance travelled in the time of 1 complete vibration= λ \\n∴ the distance travelled in the time of f complete vibrations = ƒ λ \\nSince the frequency is ƒ, so f numbers of waves are produced in 1 second. ∴ the distance travelled in one second by the wave = ƒ λ  \\nThis is the velocity of wave, v. \\nTherefore, velocity of wave, v = ƒλ … … … (7.2) \\nMathematical example 7.1: The wavelength of sound produced by an object in the air \\nis 20cm .If the velocity of sound in the air is 340ms\\n-1, find the frequency and period of \\nthe object.  \\nWe know, \\nVelocity= ƒ λ   \\nƒ Hz m msv1700 20.0/ 3401= ==−\\nλ                            \\nT= 1\\nf  = 1\\n1700s-1  = 0.000588s=5.88×10-4s        \\nThe frequency 1700 Hz; Period (time) 05.88×10-4s                          \\n7.5. Sound Wave:  \\nWe know that the sound is a power. This power is \\ncirculated through wave. Sound wave is a longitudinal wave. During the circulation of this wave, the detraction \\nand expansion of the substance are created (Fig \\n7.9).This sound wave makes a sense of hearing in our ear by being circulated from the medium. It is \\nnoticeable that the sound is not created without \\nvibration. When tune-pin copper, bowl, the bell of school is ringing, you will understand that they are vibrating if you touch them. When you speak, you will see that your throat \\nis vibrating. Here, \\nWave-length, λ=20cm=0.2m \\nSound-velocity=340ms-1 \\nFrequency, ƒ =? \\nPeriod (time), T=? \\nFigure: 7.9 '),\n",

Strike the bowl. You can hear sound. Small waves are \\nseen on the water. Now hold the bowl by your hand. Can you hear sound now? Is there any \\nwave in water?  \\nAs long as the bowl produces sound it continues its vibration. \\nSo, small waves are produced in water. While the vibration of the bowl stops, the sound stops, so does the wave. So it is \\nunderstood that a vibrating object can produce sound. But it \\ndoes not mean that any vibration of any object can produce audible sound. For an audible sound there must have a \\nmaterial medium between the source of sound and the listener, \\nand the frequency will be in between \\n20Hz to 20000Hz . \\nCharacteristics of sound wave: \\nVibration of an objects produces sound wave and an elastic material medium is needed \\nfor its propagation. So, sound is called a mechanical wave. Since the direction of propagation of wave and of particles are in the same direction, so is longitudinal. The \\nvelocity of sound wave depends on the nature of the medium. The velocity   of sound in \\ngaseous medium is less, high in liquid and higher in solid. The intensity of sound wave \\nis directly to the square of its amplitude. So higher the amplitude, the higher is the intensity. \\nReflection, refraction and superposition are possi ble in case of sound wave. The velocity of \\nsound wave depends on the temperatur e and the humidity of medium too.   \\n7.6 Echo \\nIf anyone produces a sound standing near the bank of a river, many of us have the \\nexperience of hearing the repetition of that sound after a while. The same case happens if we produce sound standing near a hill or a building. If a sound is produced in a big \\nempty house, the same sound   is heard just after a while. These phenomena take place \\ndue to the reflection of sound. When a sound becomes separate from its original sound and is repeated due to reflection then this reflected sound is called echo. Simply we can \\nsay that the reflection of sound is echo. \\nThe minimum distance of reflector \\nA sound that is heard persists 0.1 second in our brain. It is called the persistence period of \\nhearing. If any new sound reaches our ear in th is period we cannot hear it. Therefore for \\nhearing an echo of any sound the distance between the source of sound and reflector must be such that the reflected wave cannot come back to the listener before a time of 0.1 second. If \\nthe velocity of sound in the air at 0°C is considered to be 332ms\\n-1 then in 0.1 sec sound can \\ntravel 33.2 m. Therefore a reflector must be placed at a minimum distance of 33.2/2 or 16.6 m from the listener. \\nNow tell why echo is not heard in a small house? \\n7.7 Uses of echo \\nDetermination of the depth of a well: \\nDepth of water surface of a well can be very easily determined by \\nmeans of echo. When a sound is produced at the mouth of the \\nwell, it being reflected from its water surface heard in the form of         Figure: 7.10 \\n  Figure: 7.11 '),\n",

The time between the production of sound and the hearing of echo is determined \\nby means of a stopwatch.  \\nLet, \\ndepth of well = h  \\nthe time difference between the production of sound and hearing of echo = t  \\n Speed of sound = v  Now the distance travelled by reflected sound to the listener is 2h. Therefore, \\n2h = V × t  \\nor, h =  \\nIf the depth of the well is less than 16.6m, it will not be possible to perform this \\nexperiment as it is based on echo. \\nIn the same way this method can also be used to find mineral substances in the earth.  \\nFlying of bat: \\n \\nBat flies using the echo of sound as it cannot see. Bat can produce and hear ultrasonic \\nsound. We cannot hear ultrasonic sound. Bat produces ultrasonic sound and spread it \\nforward which reflects back to the bat from a reflector. Bat can understand from the \\nreflected sound if there is any object before it. It hunts its prey using this technique. If the sound does not reflect back then it can understand that there is open space and it flies \\nthat way. Sometimes the bat fails to detect the position of wires of electric lines and flies \\nthrough the parallel wires and gets stuck and becomes dead as soon as the positive and negative electric lines get connected with its  body. This is why sometimes bats are found \\nhanging dead from electric lines.  \\nBat can produce and hear the sound of frequency about 1,00,000 Hz. \\n7.8 Variation of velocity of sound \\nIt takes some time when sound reaches our ear from its source. The distance travelled by \\nsound in one second is called velocity of sound. The velocity of sound depends on some factors. \\nNature of medium: Velocity of sound in different media is different. For example \\nvelocity of sound in air, water and iron is different. At 20°C the velocity of sound in air is 344ms\\n-1, in water it is 1450ms-1 and in iron it is 5130ms-1. Generally we can see the \\nvelocity of sound in air is less, in liquid it is higher and highest in solid.   V × t  \\n2 \\n Figure: 7.12'),\n",

Connect the pots with a thin wire of \\napproximately twenty meter long. Your friend is speaking through a pot. Try to hear that \\nsound by putting your ear in contact with another pot. \\nCan you hear what your friend is saying? Yes, I can. Here sound is travelling through the \\nwire which is a solid substance. \\n \\nTemperature:  The more the temperature increases, the more the velocity of sound in \\nthe air increases. For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in summer than that of in \\nwinter. \\nCalculate:  The velocity of sound is 344ms-1 at 20 ˚C temperature and 332ms-1 at 0 ˚. How \\nmuch does the velocity of sound increases  for the increase of temperature by 1°C? \\n \\nHumidity of air: The velocity of sound increases with  the increase of humidity. For this \\nreason, the velocity of sound is more in the humid air than that of in dry air. \\n7.9 Audibility range and their uses: \\nWe know, the sound is not produced without vibration. If an object vibrates at least 20 \\ntimes per second then the sound produced from that will be heard. Thus, if the frequency \\nis more than 20000 Hz; the sound will not be heard also. So, the range of sound that we can hear is from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz. This frequency range is called range of audibility. If the frequency of any source is less than 20 Hz then it is called infrasonic vibration. If the frequency of any source is more than 20000 Hz then it is called ultrasonic vibration. Though man cannot hear the ultrasonic sound animals like bats, dogs, bees can produce and hear it. \\nThe application and use of Ultrasonic sound: \\n Determination of the depth of ocean: \\n To measure the depth of ocean a machin e is used which is called SONAR. The \\nelaboration of SONAR is Sound Navigation And Ranging. There is a system of \\nreceiving and transmitting ultrasonic sound in this machine.   Figure: 7.13 '),\n",

If the recorded time of transmitting and \\nreceiving is subtracted then the time of trav eling is found. Suppose this time is t and the \\ndepth of the ocean is d. If the velocity of sound in the water is v, then \\nit = vt \\nor, d = vt\\n2                                                                                                                        (7.3)  \\nThe summation of the distance travelled during return and transmission of sound is d+d \\n= 2d. \\nBy knowing the velocity of sound, the depth of ocean can be measured with the help of \\nthe above equation. \\nTo clear the dirt of clothes:  The clothes can be washed by the modern washing \\nmachine. Mixing soap or powder soap with water the clothes are soaked in it then \\nultrasonic sound is passed through it. This sound removes the dirt from the clothes and they are cleaned. \\nTo diagnose disease: As the internal photograph of human body can be captured by X-\\nray, in the same way the disease can also be identified by capturing picture through ultrasonic sound. This process is known as  Ultrasonography. This sound is transmitted \\ninside the body and the reflected sound is converted into light energy and casted on the \\ntelevision screen. As a result, the disease can be identified. \\nIn medical science:  Ultrasonic sound is used for scaling the teeth or to remove the \\nstones from teeth. Ultrasonic sound is also used to remove small stones from kidney by \\nturning them into dust. \\nFor other uses:  \\nUltrasonic sound is used to find out fine cracks in metal blocks or metal sheets, to clean \\ntiny electronic machines and also to destroy the harmful \\ngerms. \\nThe uses of infrasonic sound:  \\nThe range of infrasonic sound is from 1 Hz to 20 Hz. Men \\ncannot hear this sound but some animals can hear it. Elephants communicate with each other using infrasonic \\nsound. This sound can travel a long distance without any \\n \\nFigure: 7.15 '),\n",

This type of sound is produced during earth quakes and nuclear explosions and \\ndestroys many things with great shake.  \\n Mathematical example 7.3  \\nA man clapped standing on one of the banks of a river. Echo is heard after 1.5s due to \\nthe reflection of the sound from another bank. If the velocity of sound at that time is 340ms\\n-1, what is the breadth of the river? \\nSolution:  \\nSuppose the breadth of river d.  \\nWe know, \\n        2d= v.t              \\nSo,    d = vt\\n2  \\n        =  340ms-1×1.5 s\\n2  \\n         =255m \\nso, the width of river is 255m. \\n7.10. Musical sound and its characteristics: \\nWe hear different kind of sounds every day. We hear the sound of vehicles, the sound of \\nmarket, the sound of rainfall, the sound of musical instruments etc every day. Some of \\nthese sounds are sweet and some are harsh. If we judge by our sensation the sweet sounds are musical sounds. \\nThe characteristics of musical sound:  \\nThe three characteristics of musical sounds are- \\n1) Loudness or Intensity   2) Pitch and   3) Quality or Timbre. \\nLoudness or Intensity:  \\nLoudness or intensity means how loud the sound is. Intensity is the amount of sound energy flowing per second per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation of \\nsound. In SI system of unit the unit of intensity of sound is Wm\\n-2. \\nPitch:   \\nThe characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between a shrill sound \\nand a dull sound of same intensity is called pitch. Pitch depends on the frequency of the \\nsource. With the increase of frequency the pitch becomes higher making the note more and more shrill. \\nQuality or Timbre:   \\nThe characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between two sounds of same intensity and pitch is called quality or timbre. \\nWhy the voice of men is deep and the voice of women and children is sharp? \\nThere are two membranes in our vocal which are known as vocal chords. The sound is \\nproduced due to the vibration of vocal chords and so people can speak. Here,\\nvelocity, v=340ms-1 \\ntime, t=1.55  \\ndistance, d=?  '),\n",

For this, the frequency of voice of the adult men is less and the \\nfrequency of voice of women and children are more. So the voice of men is deep but the \\nvoice of children and women is sharp. \\n7.11. Noise pollution \\nSound is necessary for mutual communication and exchanging feelings. But the \\nunnecessary sounds and noises are intolerable. When the sound from different sources cross the normal limit of tolerance and causes annoyance and harm to health then it is \\ncalled noise pollution. \\nThe excessive use of mike, the sound of dram, the sound of the explosion of bomb,  the \\nsound from industries, the horn of vehicles, loud sound from tape-recorder and television \\nput, the sound from the engine of old car, the sound of aero plane and fighter plane etc. \\nare the main causes of noise pollution. \\nContinuous loud sound increases mental stress and makes the temper rough. It causes \\nvomiting tendency, lack of appetite, high blood-pressure, complex diseases of heart and \\nbrain, sickness from lack of sleep, tiredness, lack of potentiality, lack of memory, headache etc. Sudden loud sound can damage our hearing. \\nAt present, noise pollution is creating many severe problems. Very often the patients and \\nthe examinees become sick due to noise pollution. Reducing noise is the way to remain safe from noise pollution. We can take a few steps in this regard. We have to refrain \\nourselves from using mike loudly in any ceremony. The use of fireworks and bang sticks \\nmust be banned in the festivals. We should avoid using the horn of vehicles unnecessarily and loudly. We can reduce noise pollution by buying low sound producing \\nengine and by establishing industries and airport far from residential area. Open areas \\nshould be preserved in the city and more and more trees should be planted to absorb the noise. By using noise-absorbing machine in the industries and by making people \\nconscious the noise pollution can be controlled. \\n \\n \\n \\nExercise \\nA.

When light \\ncomes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into \\nthe eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve \\nknowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that \\nlight falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object.  \\nThe major properties of light are:  \\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. \\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity \\nin vacuum is \\n831 0c=×  ms-1\\n.  \\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light \\ntake place. \\n4. Light is a form of energy. \\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. \\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. \\n8.2 Laws of reflection of light \\nWe see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and \\nsome are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own \\nare called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, \\nchalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non-luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the \\nobject. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this \\nwe can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object \\nbecause light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object \\nreflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. \\n \\nFigure 8.1 '),\n",

But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of \\na second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the \\nsurface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. \\nLaws of reflection: \\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: \\n1. First law:  The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on \\nthe reflector lie in the same plane.  \\n2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  \\n \\nFigure 8.2: Reflection of light  \\nWhen light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How \\nlight will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. \\nDepending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.  \\n1. Regular or uniform reflection \\n2. Diffused or irregular reflection  \\n1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after  \\nreflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of \\nlight incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains \\nparallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular \\nreflection.  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection                      Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection  \\n '),\n",

In this case, \\nthe rays incident at different angles at di fferent point of incidence on the rough surface, \\nas a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of \\ntheir surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are \\ndiffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects \\nare viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. \\n8.3 Mirror \\nA mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an \\nobject placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light.  \\nA mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror \\nis prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with \\nmercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface \\nhaving metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.  \\nMirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- \\n1. Plane mirror \\n2. Spherical mirror \\nPlane mirror:  If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of \\nlight takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.  \\nSpherical mirror \\nIf the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. \\nSpherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is \\ncut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made.   Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: \\n1. Concave mirror \\n2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if \\nregular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, \\nthen it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a '),\n",

In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging \\nmirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never \\nmeets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. \\nSome definitions related to spherical mirrors \\nPole: T he central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of \\nthe mirror.  In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror,  while it is the highest point in a convex \\nmirror.  \\nCenter of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is \\ncalled the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. \\nRadius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is \\ncalled the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by  r. \\n \\nFigure: 8.7 \\nPrincipal axis:  The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of \\na spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC  is the \\nprincipal axis. \\nSecondary axis: The straight line passing through the centre of curvature and any point \\nother than the pole on the reflecting surface of the sphere is called the secondary axis.

It is not only in the case of mirrors, \\nwhen you walk by the side of a pond or a river, your image appears in water that time \\nalso. This reflection is your image.  When light is reflected in a mirror from your body or \\nan object and comes to your eyes we see the image at that time.  \\nWhen light reflected from an object comes directly to our eyes, we see the object then. \\nAgain, if light does not enter our eyes directly rather it comes to our eyes being reflected or refracted in another medium, then also we see the object. Then it seems that the object \\nis not in its actual position. When you see your image in a mirror, then it appears to you \\nthat you are behind the mirror. Actually you are in front of the mirror. The reflection of an object seen at the new position due to the presence of the mirror is called the image of \\nthat object.  \\n \\nFigure 8.10 '),\n",

The point I  is the image of the \\npoint O.  \\n \\nFigure 8.11 \\nIn figure 8.11, O is a point object in front of a plane mirror.

As these two rays are diverging, \\nif they are extended backward they meet at the point I. Therefore, the reflected rays seem \\nto be diverging from the point I behind the mirror. This point I  is the image of the point O.   \\nIf a beam of rays after being reflected from or refracted through any surface meet at a \\nsecond point or appears to diverge from the second point, then the second point is called the image of the first point. An object is the sum of innumerable points. As a result, \\nimage of an object is formed as like as an individual point. \\nClassification of images When you see your appearance in a mirror, you see your image behind the mirror. This \\nhappens due to the reflection of light. Image like this formed in a mirror, through which \\nlight ray do not actually meet, is called virtual image. Images in which light rays actually meet together (e.g.- images on a cinema screen) are called real images. The pictures \\nformed in the screen of a digital camera are real images. Real images can be displayed in \\na screen but the virtual images cannot be displayed in a screen. Images are of two types- \\n(A) Real image \\n(B) Virtual image \\n(A)Real image: If light rays emitted from a point after being reflected or refracted on a \\nsurface actually converge at a second point, th en this second point is called the real \\nimage of the first point. In figure 8.10, I is the real image due to reflection. \\n(B) Virtual image: If light rays emitted from a point after being reflected or refracted on \\na surface seem to diverge from a second point, then this second point is called the virtual \\nimage of the first point.

Simple periscope: Periscope is used to see a distant object directly if there is an \\nobstacle. A simple periscope is constructed using two plane mirrors. This instrument is \\nformed utilizing successive reflection of light. In figure 8.20 a simple periscope is shown. Here, two plane mirrors are placed \\nparallel to each other at an angle of 45 ° with the axis of a long \\nrectangular wood or metal tube. At first parallel light rays from the distant object incident on the mirror M\\n1 at angle of 45 ° \\nwith the normal to the mirror. The incident ray is reflected by \\nthe mirror M 1 at an angle 45 ° and incident on the mirror M 2 \\ntravelling along the axis. The light ray is again reflected by the \\nmirror M 2 and enters the eyes horizontally. So, the object can \\nbe seen. \\nThus by changing the direction of light we can see objects which cannot be seen directly \\nusing plane mirrors.  \\nPeriscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe \\nthe movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used \\nusing prism in a submarine. \\n2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting \\nhair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front \\nmirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This \\nimage works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror.  \\n3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the \\nteeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for \\ndifferent purposes.    \\n8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for differe nt purposes.  These are described below: \\nPlane mirror \\n1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors.  \\n2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for \\nreading the alphabets easily. \\n3. Periscopes are constructed using plane mirrors. \\n4.

Optical instruments like telescope, overhead projector, and laser are made using \\nplane mirrors. \\n6. During shooting of drama, cinema etc. brightness of any place is increased by \\nreflecting light by plane mirror. \\nConcave mirror \\n1. Using suitable size of the concave mirror, the magnified and erect image of the face \\nis formed in a concave mirror. It helps in beautification and shaving.   \\n2. The dentists use concave mirror. \\n3. Concave mirrors are used as reflectors. For example- the concave mirror is used in \\ntorch light, search light of launch and steamers to determine the path. \\n4. Using concave mirror, the light and heat energy, etc. is centralized to heat a body. \\nBesides, it is used to collect Radar and TV signal. For instance- dish antenna, solar \\noven, telescope and Radar collector etc. \\n5. Since, the light rays can be centralized at a point using a concave mirror, the doctor \\nuse this mirror to examine eye, ear, nose and throat.  \\nConvex mirror \\n1. Since, a convex mirror always produce a virtual, erect and diminished image, it is \\nused in cars to see the vehicles and passersby behind. In marriage ceremony it is \\nused as view mirrors. \\n2. Since a wide range of area can be seen with the help of a convex mirror it is used in \\nshopping mall or shop for security purpose.  \\n3. It is used to prepare reflecting telescope. \\n4. It is used as reflector in the street lamps, since it spreads light over a large area. \\n8.8 Safe driving \\nTo drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. \\nFor perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of \\nhim. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car.  For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors \\njust after he gets on the car.  \\n8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads \\nTo drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in \\nbad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driv ing in a hilly road is very risky. Since, \\nhilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it \\nbecomes necessary to take turn by 90 ° for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, \\nthe driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from \\nopposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side.

It is seen that if the angles \\nof incidence are i\\n1, i2, i3, ……. and their respective \\nangles of refraction are r 1, r2, r3, …. then, sin i 1\\nsin r 1  = sin i 2\\nsin r 2 = \\nsin i 3\\nsin r 3 = constant \\nThe value of this constant depends upon the nature of media and the colour of the light \\nused. Again it is seen that AB, BC and the normal NBN ′ are on the plane of your book. \\nFrom this observation we see that refraction of light follows the following two laws. \\nFirst law:  The incident ray, normal drawn at the point of incidence on the surface of \\nseparation and the refracted ray lie on the same plane. \\nSecond law:  When light enters obliquely to a transparent medium from another transparent \\nmedium then for a fixed pair of media and for a fixed colour of light the ratio of the sine of the \\nangle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction always remains constant. \\nThis law is also known as Snell’s law. \\n9.2 Refractive index \\nFor a particular pair of transparent medium and a particular colour of light when ray of \\nlight refracts from one medium to another, then if the angle of incidence is i and the \\nangle of refraction is r, then sin i\\n sin r  will be a constant and it is called refractive index of \\nthe second medium with respect to the first medium for that colour of light.

In this situation the angle \\nof incidence in the denser medium ( ∠P1QN′) is called the critical angle with respect to \\nthe rarer medium. In fig: 9.7(b) ∠P1QN′ = θc = critical angle. The value of this critical \\nangle also depends on the nature of the medium and the colour of light. \\nTotal Internal Reflection: \\nIf the angle of incidence in denser medium is increased further ( i > θc), then the incident \\nray of light will be totally reflected in the denser medium. In this case no refracted ray \\ncan be observed. In this situation the separating surface of the two media behaves like a \\nmirror. This phenomenon is called the total internal reflection. \\nIn fig: 9.7(c) the angle of incidence in denser medium ∠P2QN′ is greater than the \\ncritical angle θc of the two media. For this reason the light ray P 2Q incidents on \\nseparating surface AB and reflects along QR 2 following the laws of reflection.  \\nConditions for total internal reflection: \\ni) The ray of light must incident from a denser medium at the surface of separation of a \\ndenser and a rarer medium. \\nii) The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle. \\n9.4 Mirage \\nSometimes thirsty traveler in desert sees the inverted image of a distant tree and thinks there is water. When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no \\nwater. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called \\nmirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a \\nresult the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively \\ncolder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from \\nthe normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is \\ngreater than the critical angle and total intern al reflection occurs. At that time the upside \\ndown image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. \\n \\nObservation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer \\ndays you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery. It seems that there is water on the \\nroad. A similar phenomenon like mirage in a desert has happened here.  Figure: 9.8 '),\n",

The refractive index of \\nthe material of fiber is 1.7. A layer is made on this fiber by a material of comparatively less \\nrefractive index (1.5). When light ray that \\nincidents at a small angle enters through one end of the fiber, then successive total internal \\nreflections of light take place on the wall of the \\nfiber and finally it emerges through the other end.  \\nLight can be sent through the fiber almost without any loss of energy even if it is bent or \\ncoiled. A set of optical fiber is called optical tube.  \\nUses of optical fiber in the field of health and telecommunication: An optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner \\nwall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to \\nlighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the \\nblock inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical \\nfiber is used for sending or receiving electri cal signals from one place to another. Before \\nsending, the electrical signal has to be converted into optical signal. \\nNear about 2000 telephone signals can be transmitted at a time through a single optical \\nfiber. Almost no change takes place to the intensity of the signals for this kind of transmission. The use of optical fiber at present has brought about a significant change in \\ncommunication system.  \\n9.6 Lenses and their Classification: A lens is a transparent refractive medium bounded by \\ntwo spherical surfaces. \\nLenses are of two types: i) Convex lens or converging lens \\nii) Concave lens or diverging lens \\nConvex lens: The lens whose mid portion  is thick  \\nbut the edges are thin is called convex lens. As the \\nconvex lens can converge a beam of parallel light \\nrays after refraction hence it is also called converging lens. [ Fig. 9.10A] \\nConcave lens: The lens whose mid portion  is thin  but the edges are thick is called \\nconcave lens. As the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel light rays after refraction hence it is also called diverging lens. [Fig. 9.10 B] Figure: 9.9 \\nFigure: 9.10 '),\n",

The centre \\nof each sphere is called the centre of curvature of the respective surface. In figure: 9.11 \\nC1 and C 2 are two centres of curvature of the lens LN. If one of the surfaces is plane \\ninstead of spherical then its centre of curvature will be at infinity. \\nPrincipal axis: Generally there are two spherical surfaces of a lens. The straight line \\npassing through the two centres of curvature of the two spherical surfaces is called the principal axis. In figure 9.11 the straight line C\\n1C2 is the principal axis of the lens. \\n \\nFigure: 9.11 \\nOptical centre: The point on the principal axis inside a lens through which if a ray of \\nlight is passed then due to refraction if the ray emerges from the other surface being \\nparallel to the incident ray then it is called optical centre. \\nIn figure 9.12 a ray of light PQ incidents on a surface of lens and refracts along the path \\nQR. This ray emerges from the other surface along the path RS. The emergent ray RS \\nand incident ray PQ are parallel to each other. The refracted ray QR intersects the principal axis C\\n1C2 at point O inside the lens. The point O is called the optical centre of \\nthe lens. \\n \\nFigure: 9.12 \\nFor a thin lens the point on the principal axis through which if the ray of light is passed \\nand due to refraction no deviation of ray takes place that point inside the lens is called \\noptical centre. \\nPrincipal focus:  When a pencil of parallel rays adjacent to the principal axis incident on \\na lens in a direction parallel to principal axis, then after refraction the refracted rays \\neither actually converge to a point on the principal axis (in the case of convex lens) or \\nthey appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis (in the case of concave lens). This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. In figure 9.13 the \\npoint F is the principal focus of the lens. '),\n",

Why? \\nAfter  being refracted by convex lens, magnified image is formed and so you are seeing \\nthe writings larger. \\n9.8 Power of lens:  Suppose there are two convex lenses. The focal length of the first one is greater and the \\nfocal length of the second one is smaller. \\n \\n             Figure: 9.18         Figure: 9.19 \\nNow if a beam of parallel rays of light parallel to the principal axis incidents on the lens \\nthen after refraction the rays will meet at the principal focus. In the case of second lens \\nthat focal point will not be as far as the firs t one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a \\nconvex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the fi rst lens is less than that of the second one. \\nThe power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the \\nfocal length is greater.  \\nIn figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of \\nconcave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more \\nis its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power.  \\nIn general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a \\nconvergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens. \\nThere is a relation between the power P and focal length f. That is, P =            .  \\nThe power of a lens of focal length one meter is called one diapter (d). The power of \\nspectacle that the eye specialists recommend is written in diapter unit. f 1 '),\n",

SO, distance of real object, distance of real image and distance of real focus are all taken to be positive. All virtual distances are negative.

We know that \\nphotograph is taken by keeping the object before a camera. Similarly if any object is \\nplaced before the eyes, there is a picture of that image inside the eyes. The structure and functions of eyes are discussed below. \\nThe structure of eyes: \\n1.  Eye-ball: The circular object situated in the eye cavity/orbit is called the eye-ball. \\nThis ball is flattened in its front and back. It can rotate around a certain area in the \\neye cavity. \\n2.  Sclerotic: It is composed of white, strong and dense fibrous tissues [fig: 9.20]. It \\ndetermines the size of the eyes and protects the \\neyes and save them from any external hazards. \\n3. Cornea: It is the frontal part of sclerotic. This part \\nof sclerotic is transparent and slightly convex at the outer side. \\n4.  Choroid: There is a deep black layer on the inner \\nside of the sclera. This is called choroids. Due to \\nthis black layer light is not reflected internally \\nwithin the eye. \\n5.  Iris: Just behind the cornea, there is an opaque \\ndiaphragm. It is called Iris. The colour of the Iris may vary from person to person. Usually the colour of Iris is black, light azure or deep brown. Iris regulates the \\namount of light falling on the eye lens. \\n6.  Pupil: The hole at the centre of the Iris is called Pupil. Through this pupil, light \\nenters the eyes. \\n7.  Eye lens: It is the most important part of the eye. It is situated just behind the pupil. \\nIt is made of transparent organic substances. Its radius of curvature of the back side \\nis greater than that of the front side. This lens is hooked in the eye ball by ciliary Given, \\n Focal length,  f = +0.1m \\n Power, P =? \\nf 1 \\n+0.11 \\nFigure: 9.20  '),\n",

Due to the contractions and suspension of these \\nmuscles and ligaments, the curvature of the lens changes. It ultimately changes the \\nfocal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our \\nfocal length.  \\n8.  Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive \\nmembrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of \\nsome nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve-\\nfibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain. \\nAqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space \\nbetween the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly \\nlike substance that fills the gap between re tina and eye lens is called vitreous humour. \\nAccommodation of eye:  If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real \\nimage at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted \\nimage of the object is found on the screen. \\nExperiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any \\nreason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be \\nmoved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear \\nimage of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. \\nThings happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens \\nand vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that obj ect is reflected on our retina, then there will \\nbe a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of \\ndifferent distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change \\nof the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same \\ndistance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the \\naccommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye.  \\nLeast distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the \\nobject is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be \\nseen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the \\ndistance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any \\nobject clearly that stays closer to this distance.  \\nAgain, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest \\ndistance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any \\nnormal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance. '),\n",

As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision.  \\nAdvantage of having two eyes: \\nIf we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye \\nforms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the \\nobject better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly. \\n9.10 Function of an eye: \\nWe have known earlier that there is a convex lens just behind the pupil of the eye which \\nis called eye lens. It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects.  \\n \\nFigure: 9.21  \\nIn figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an \\nobject. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and \\nis refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP 1. Another ray PO coming \\nfrom P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP 1. The \\nrefracted rays RP 1 and OP 1 meet at point P 1. From point P 1 a perpendicular P 1Q1 is \\ndrawn on the principal axis. So, P 1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ.  \\nWhere the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or \\nnerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of \\nstimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object.  \\nIt is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation \\nis transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size. \\n9.11 Defects of vision and its remedy  \\nThe range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to \\nsee any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye \\nhas two kinds of defects. These are: '),\n",

Short sight or Myopia \\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia 1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant \\nobject distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight. \\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of  the eye \\nball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ] \\nEffects of such problem:  In this case, rays of light coming \\nfrom any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen distinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at infinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F.  For this reason, such type of eye cannot see \\nobject distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ] \\nRemedy:  It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the \\npower of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles. \\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a \\nposition nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye. \\n2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant \\nobjects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.  \\nEffect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming \\nfrom the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].  \\nFigure: 9.22  \\nFigure: 9.23  '),\n",

Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of \\nconvergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal \\nlength i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles. \\nWe also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance \\ngreater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or \\npower is used in this case as aid lens or spect acles in front of the eye. The focal length of \\nthis lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed \\nat normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye. [Fig 9.23 (c)]   \\n9.12 Perceptions of coloured object: When we see an object, then the light from the object falls on our eyes. The light being \\nrefracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous \\nnerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from \\nretinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There \\nare three types of cone cells – blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or \\ncomplex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The \\ncone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object. \\n9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:      \\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, \\nbeing refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object \\nwhen a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light \\nhelps us to see an object. \\nThere are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the \\ndistant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use \\nspectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an \\nimportant role to see an object.  \\nBy using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can \\nsee very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by \\ntelescope.  \\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the \\ncontribution of refraction of light. \\nThere are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the \\naquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light \\nthrough the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of \\nrefraction of light. \\n '),\n",

Before combing his \\nhair he rubbed the comb with his woolen pullover for a while. While combing his hair he \\nobserved surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov br ings the comb close to the tale he observes \\nthe comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same \\nkind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. \\nDo it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some \\npieces of paper. \\nWe see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged \\nthat is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its \\nproduction. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. \\nWe know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter \\nconsists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two \\ntype of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the ma tter consist of is electrical property, which \\nis determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of \\nprotons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally \\nan atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole \\natom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. \\nAs long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically \\nneutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If \\nthe number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scatte red electrons are joined with any atom, the \\nnumber of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or \\nexcess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. \\nThe substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called \\nconductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors. \\nCopper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors. On the other hand the substances \\nthrough which electricity or electric charge cannot pass easily are called nonconductors or insulator, such as wood, paper, glass etc. \\n10.2 Electrification by friction: \\nExperiment: Suspend a light pith ball freely with a string from a stand or a hook. Rub one end \\nof a glass rod with a piece of dry silk cloth very  well. It will be more convenient if the glass \\nrod and the silk are dried to make them warm. Now bring the rubbed end of the glass rod near \\nthe freely suspended pith ball.  '),\n",

But every \\natom has got affinity for getting excess electr ons. This affinity for excess electron is \\ndifferent in different substances. That is why when two bodies are brought in contact \\nwith each other, the body which has greater affinity for electron collect electrons from \\nother body and gets charged negatively this ha ppens when a glass rod is rubbed with silk.    \\n \\nFigure: 10.1           Figure: 10.2              Figure: 10.3 \\n[Fig: 10.1] Silk has more electron affinity than glass and as such these two are rubbed \\ntogether, the electron of glass goes to silk. As a result, the silk gets charged negatively and the glass rod becomes positively charged. Th is is why glass rod attracts pith ball \\n[Fig; 10.2]. Again when a rod of ebonite or polythene is rubbed with flannel, polythene \\nrod gets charged negatively and the fl annel becomes positively charged. Because \\npolythene has more affinity for electrons than that of flannel and so when they are \\nrubbed together free electrons of flannel moves to ebonite or polythene and gets charged \\nnegatively [Fig 10.3]. \\n10.3 Electric Induction \\nWe know that when two bodies are rubbed together electric charge is produced. Again \\nwhen a charged body is brought in contact with another neutral body the later is charged. \\nWhen the neutral body is placed not in contact with the charged body but close to the \\ncharged body, the former becomes charged. This happens due to induction. The process of charging a neutral body by bringing it very near to the charged body is called \\nelectrostatic induction. With a simple experiment the electrostatic induction has been \\nexplained below. \\n \\nFigure: 10.4 \\nExperiment: A dry glass rod is rubbed with silk. One end of the rod is brought very \\nnear to the neutral conductor rod AB keeping the other end of the glass rod in hand [Fig: \\n10.4(a)]. As a result the free electrons of the conductor are attracted by the positive charges of the glass rod and move the end A. Therefore, the end B falls in short of \\nelectrons and is charged positively. The end A is charged negatively. With a charge \\ncollector [a small metal sheet attached to a nonconductor handle] if some charges are collected from end B and their nature is detected with the help of an electroscope then \\nthe above discussion will be proved.

Due to the presence of the charges glass rod equal \\namount of opposite charges are separated only and move towards the end o the \\nconductor. As long as the glass rod is present near the conductor AB, the opposite \\ncharges are separated and remain at the end of the conductor. \\nIn the above experiment the positive charges in the glass rod which has created induction \\nin the conductor AB is called inducing charge. The charges which are accumulated in the \\nconductor A are called induced charge.     \\nExtended activities:  Rub a balloon full of air with your shirt. Then press the balloon with the \\nwall of your house for a while and then release it. What did you observe? The balloon \\nbecomes attached to the wall. \\nExtended activities:  Rub a plastic object with  your shirt. Then hold it near a narrow flow of \\nwater falling from a tap. The flow of water will bend towards the plastic object.  \\n \\nThe negative charge of the balloon produces electrostatic induction in the wall. The \\ninduced positive charge in the wall attracts the negatively charged balloon [Fig: 10.5]. \\nSame case occurs with the narrow flow of tap water [Fig 10.6]. \\n10.4 Electroscope \\nThe instrument which detects the presence and nature of charge in any body is called \\nelectroscope. A metallic circular disk is fixe d on the top of brass or any metallic rod R \\n[Fig: 10.7] and at lower end of the rod two li ght leaves of gold are attached. Instead of \\ngold aluminium or any other light metal can also be used. The lower end of the rod with \\nthe leaves is placed in a glass jar passing through a cork of nonconductor matter C. As \\nthe apparatus is kept inside a glass jar, the humidity and the wind cannot damage the \\ninstrument. \\nCharging the electroscope: \\nIf a glass rod is rubbed with silk, it becomes positively charged. If that \\ncharged rod is attached to the disk or sphere of the electroscope, some charge is transferred from the rod to the disk. This charge reaches to \\nthe gold leaves through conducting metal rod. As the gold leaves \\nreceive similar charges, they repel each other and move away from each other or explode. In this situation, if the glass is removed but the \\ngap between the leaves is not reduced, then it can be decided that the \\nelectroscope is charged with positive ions. To charge the electroscope with negative ions, an ebonite rod should be rubbed with flannel and \\nthis negatively charged ebonite rod be allowed to touch the disk in the \\nabove mentioned process. As a result, the gold leaves of the electroscope will be charged Figure: 10.5 Figure: 10.6 \\nFigure: 10.7 '),\n",

The more is \\nthe quantity of charge the more will be the gap between the leaves. \\nDetection of existence of electric charge: \\nTo determine the presence of charge in any body, the body may be brought to an unchanged electroscope. If the two leaves move away from each other then it is \\nunderstood that there is an existence of charge in the body but if they don’t move away \\nfrom each other then it is understood that the body has no charge.  \\nDetection of the nature of charge: \\nTo know the nature of charge in any charged body, the electroscope should be charged \\neither positively or negatively. Suppose the electroscope is charged positively. In this \\nposition, the leaves having positive charge will stay apart. Now if the experimental body \\nis brought in contact with the disk of the electroscope and if the gap between the leaves \\ndecreases, then it is understood that the body is charged negatively. On the other hand if the gap increases due to touching the disk with the experimental body, then it is \\nunderstood that the body is positively charged.  \\n10.5 Electric Force:   \\nNature of force: \\nA positively charged plastic rod is suspended by nylon string. [Fig: 10.8]  \\n \\nFigure: 10.8 \\nNow a negatively charged polythene rod is brought near it. What do you observe? The \\nplastic rod will move towards the polythene rod. So, it is proved that two oppositely charged object attract each other. [Fig: 10.8 (a)]  \\nNow what will you observe when a positively charged plastic rod is brought near a \\nfreely suspended positively charged plastic rod the suspended rod will move apart quickly. That is charges of same nature repel each other. \\nCoulomb’s Law: \\nWe know that the charges of opposite nature  attract each other and charges of same \\nnature repel each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between the two charges \\ndepends on, \\n1. quantity of charges. \\n2. distance between two charges. \\n3. the nature of the medium between the two charges. \\nScientist Coulomb states a law about the force of attraction or repulsion between the two charges. This is called Coulomb’s law. Figure: 10.9 '),\n",

If the \\nforce of attraction or repulsion between these two is F, then according to Coulomb’s law, \\nF ∝   \\n \\nor, F =                          (10.1) \\nHere C is a constant of proportionality. Its value in vacuum is 9 x 109 Nm2C-2. \\nSometimes it is called coulomb’s constant. \\nUnit of charge: The unit of charge is coulomb (C). It is a derived unit. Coulomb is \\ndefined from ampere.  \\nIf 1 ampere (1 A) current flows through a conductor for 1 second (1 s), then the amount \\nof charge that passes through any cross section of the conductor is called coulomb (1 C). \\nMathematical Example 10.1: Two bodies of charges 20C and 50C are placed at a \\ndistance of 2m in vacuum.

Now if a charge +q is \\nplaced at point P, then due to the charge of A, the +q charge will \\ngain a force. We say that at point P there is a an electric field, the \\nsource of which a charged body A. That is if a charged body, in \\nwhich the influence of the charged body exists is called the electric field of the charged body. \\nElectric Intensity: \\nAccording to coulomb’s law, it is found that the nearer the point P [Fig 10.10] to the charged \\nbody A, the more will be the strength of electr ic field at that point. The strength of the \\nelectric field is called intensity.

The unit of electric charge is newton/coulomb \\n(NC-1).  \\nMathematical Problem 10.2: If a body of charge 5C is placed at a point in an electric \\nfield then it gains a force of 200N. Find the magnitude of electric intensity of that point. \\nWe know, \\nE= \\n=  \\n= 40 NC-1 \\nAns: 40 NC-1 \\nElectric Lines of Force: \\nMichel Faraday introduced electric lines of force to get an idea about electric field. If a \\npositive charge is placed in an electric field it would experience a force. If the charge is a \\nfree one, gaining this force instead of remaining stationary it would move in a definite \\npath. Electric line of force is the path of a free positive charge that moves in an electric field. There is no real existence of lines of force. These lines are imaginary. The electric \\nlines of force are used to for measuring the electric intensity and explaining its direction \\nat a point in an electric field. The lines of force of an electric field are such that, the \\ntangent drawn at a point to a line of force i ndicates the direction of electric intensity at \\nthat point. The number of lines of force passing through unit area perpendicular to the \\nlines of force at a point in the electric fiel d is proportional to magnitude of the electric \\nintensity at that point. In a diagram of lines of force of an electric field, the gap between \\nthe lines indicates the magnitude of intensity of electric field. In an electric field where \\nthe lines of forces are closer magnitude of E is greater there and where the lines of forces \\nare away magnitude of E is less there.         \\nFor different positions of charged object, the nature of the lines of force of an electric \\nfield varies. Lines of force of a few electric are described below. For the simplicity of \\ndescription the conductors are taken as spherical.  \\n1.  For an isolated positive charge the nature of lines of force is shown in figure 10.11(a). \\nIn this case the lines of force emerged uniformly from the surface of the conductor \\nperpendicularly. If the charge of the body increases \\nthen the number of lines of force also increases. \\n2. The lines of force of an electric field produced by \\ntwo equal and opposite charges are shown in figure \\n10.11(b). In this case the line of force emerges from \\npositive charge and terminates at negative charge. \\n3. The lines of force of an electric field produced by \\ntwo equal positive charges placed nearby are shown \\nin figure 10.11(c). In this case the lines of force go far away from each other; as a result there will be no lines of force in between them.

If a charge is placed at this place it will \\nexperience no force. This point is called neutral force. \\n4.  The lines of force of an electric field produced by two unequal positive charges \\nplaced nearby are shown in figure 10.11(d). In  this case, the neutral point ‘N’ would \\nnot be nearer to the smaller charges. \\n10.7 Electric Potential \\nAs there is intensity of an electric field, it also has electric potential. Potential determines \\nthe direction of motion of a charge in an electric field and also determines the direction \\nin which the charge will flow when two charged conductors are connected by a conductor wire. If the charge creating field is positive, some work is done against the \\nforce of repulsion if another positive charge is brought near it. Therefore, the more \\npositive charge is brought from a point at infinity nearer to the body, the more work will have to be done. So, within the electric field of a positively charged body, the more a \\npoint is brought nearer to the body, the mo re will be the quantity of potential. If any \\nelectric field created by a positively charged body and a free positive charge is placed and allowed to move freely, it would go away from the body. Therefore, we can say that \\npositive charge moves from higher potential to lower potential. On the other hand, \\nnegative charge moves towards positively charged body. Thus, negative charge moves from lower potential to higher potential. If the body creating the electric field is charged \\nnegatively, then some work will be done due to attraction of a unit positive charge \\nbringing towards it. A positive charge itself does work while coming from infinity towards a negatively charged body, which creates an electric field. As a result the charge \\nloses energy and the potential at a point in th e electric field is considered as negative. \\nMeasurement of potential : The work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity \\nto a point in an electric field is called the potential of that point. Again from infinity if a \\nunit of positive charge is brought near to the conductor, the work done by the electric \\nforce or against the electric force is called potential of that conductor. \\nIf a unit positive charge q is brought very near to the conductor from a point at infinity \\nand if the amount of work done is W, the potential ‘V’ of the conductor or of that point  \\n \\nwill be,   V=        \\nElectric potential determines in which direction the \\nflow of electric charge takes place when two charged conductors are electrically connected. \\nIf two positively charged metallic spheres are \\nconnected by conducting wire (fig:10.12) then any of the following phenomena may occur. \\n1. Some charge from the left sphere may go to the \\nright sphere. \\n2. Some charge from the right sphere may go to the left sphere. \\n3. The charges may remain as it is. W\\nq \\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/saifmohammed/Desktop/Physics-Chatbot/Text Book/Physics Classes 9-10 (English Version) - National Curriculum and Textbook Board of Bangladesh - PDF Room.pdf', 'page': 172}, page_content='168  Physics \\nThe movement of charge from one sphere to another does not depend on the quantity of \\ncharge of the spheres but it depends on electric potential. The positive charge will flow \\nfrom sphere to sphere of higher potential to that if lower potential. This flow of charge \\nwill continue until the potential of these two s pheres become equal. So, potential is an \\nelectric condition of a charged conductor that determines whether it takes or gives up \\ncharge when connected to another charged conductor by a connecting wire. \\nSimilarity between potential and temperature and free surface of liquid:  \\nThe role which is played by temperature and the height of free surface of liquid in heat \\nand hydrostatics respectively, potential plays the same role in electrostatics. We know, if we connect two bodies thermally, there may be exchange of heat between them. The \\nflow of heat does not depend on the mass of i.e. inherent heat within it, but on the \\ntemperature. If we connect a highly heated body with another body which is much heavier but of low in temperature, then heat will flow from the small body to the large \\nbody, though the amount of heat is much greater in the \\nlarger body than the smaller one.  \\nTwo tubes A and B are placed at same horizontal level. \\nThey are connected by a tube with a stop cock S (Fig: \\n10.13). Closing the stop cock water is poured in to A and B tubes in such a way so the height of water column is \\nsame in two tubes. As the diameter of B is much greater \\nthan that of A, to raise the water level at same height much more water is requires for tube B. Now if the stop \\ncock is opened there would be no change in water height i.e. there is no flow of water. \\nThough the amount of water is different in two tubes, but as there is height is same, so there is no flow of water. Now if closing the stop cock a little amount water is poured \\ninto A tube, the amount of water in it will still be less than that of B, but the height of \\nwater level will increase slightly. After if the stop cock is opened, then water will flow from A to and the height of the water column will w same in both A and B. It is thus \\nunderstood that flow of water does not depend on the amount of water rather the height. \\nSuppose two conductors are positively charged.  The amount of charge in first conductor \\nis greater than that of second conductor but the potential of the first one is less than that \\nof the second. Now if, two conductors are connected electricity then positively charge \\nwill flow from second conductor to first conductor. Though the amount of charge is greater in first conductor yet it will take charge because its potential is low. As a result \\nof flow of charges when the potential of the two conductor become equal then the flow \\nwill stop. \\nTherefore it can be said, the role of temperature in heat, role of free surface of liquid in \\nhydrostatic and the role of potential in electrostatic are same. \\nElectric Potential of Earth: \\nEarth is an electric conductor. When a charged body is connected to the earth, it \\nbecomes electrically neutral. When a pos itively charged body is grounded electrons \\ncoming from the earth neutralize the body. When a negatively charged body is grounded Figure: 10.13 '),\n",

The earth is so \\nbig that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. \\nLikewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. \\nThe earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of \\na place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of \\na body, the potential of earth is taken as zero. \\nZero, Positive and Negative Potential: \\nThe potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is \\nconnected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a \\npositively charged body is positive and negativ ely charged body is negative.     \\nUnit of potential, Volt:   \\nIf the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point \\nin the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V). \\nThe potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) \\npositive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done. \\nPotential difference: \\n Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are V\\nA \\nand V B respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from \\ninfinity to point A is V A and to point B is V B. Therefore  the work done in bringing a unit \\npositive charge from point B to point A is V A -V B \\ni.e. the potential difference between these two \\npoints. \\nThe work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in \\nan electric field is called potential difference between two points. \\n10.8 Electric capacitor: \\nThe capability of storing energy as electric charge \\nis called capacitor. Capacitor is the mechanical \\ndevice designed to sustain the capacitance. \\nCapacitor stores energy from a source such as electric cell and again uses it. A capacitor is made \\nby placing an insulating material such as air, \\nglass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between \\ntwo nearby conductors is called capacitor. \\nA simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other. \\nWhen a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate \\nfrom its negative rod and is charged negative ly. Electrons flow to the positive rod of \\nbattery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. \\nThe amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery.  \\nFigure: 10.14 \\nFigure: 10.15 '),\n",

Electrostatic Painting Spray:  Nowadays painting \\nspray is used to colour car, cycle, cupboard or other \\nthings with help of static electricity. Spray gun is made \\nin such a way that it produces very small charged particles of colour. The sharp edge of the painting spray \\ngun is connected to a terminal of the static electrical \\ngenerator. The other terminal of the generator is connected to the metal plate to be coloured which must \\nbe connected with earth. In case of colouring a car the charged small particle emitted \\nfrom the spray gun attracts the outer frame of the car. As a result a uniform layer of colour is formed on the outer surface of the car. Moreover these small particles move \\nalong the electric lines of force and reach the narrower places of its surface and colour it. \\n2. Ink Jet Printer: This is the most ordinary printer \\nwhich remains connected to the computer. An ink-gun \\nwith its narrow mouth projects very small particles of \\nink. These small particles are positively charged. These ink particles move through the space between two \\nplates. These positively charged ink particles are \\nrepelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate. \\nA computer controls the voltage of the plates in such a way that the plates are sometimes \\npositively charged and sometimes negatively charged. And the ink particles fall on moving paper scattered in different places to give the necessary shape of letters and \\npictures. For colour print four kinds of colour are used. \\n3. Photocopier : Nowadays photocopier or photocopy machine is very essential and thus \\nit has become very popular machine. Not only the educational institutions and other \\noffices but also general people use this machine to photocopy any kind of necessary \\npapers and documents. Static energy is also used in this machine. There is a rotating \\ndram inside the dark part of the photocopier. Positive charge is sprayed over the dram. A \\nbright light lights up the page to be photocopied. The white part of the page reflects light \\nbut the dark or printed part does not reflect light. The reflected light centers on the dram. Charges releases from the part of the dram where the reflected light from white paper \\nfalls. Only the dark part of the dram is charged positively. Negatively charged ink of \\ncarbon powder (toner) is sprayed over the dram. Negatively charged ink particles get stick to the positively charged part of the dram. A piece of white paper is positively \\ncharged and is kept pressed with the dram. This paper picks up the pattern of carbon \\npowder on its surface from the dram. Positively charged paper attracts the negatively charged toner. Then the paper is passed through the heated roller. As a result the ink of \\nthe toner gets melted and mixed with the paper and makes a permanent copy. \\n \\n Figure: 10.16 \\nFigure: 10.17 '),\n",

If the charge increases continuously the potential difference between the aero plane and the earth increases  simultaneously. Due to this high potential \\ndifference when the fuel is loaded there is possibility of releasing some charge to the \\nground which may create spark. This spark may lead to a huge explosion. This is why the wheels of aero plane are made of conductor rubber so that the stored charges in the \\naero plane can be released safely to the ground when it lands. \\nThe solution of the problem is that a conductor is to be connected to the aero plane and \\nto the ground as soon as it lands and just before the loading is started. \\nLoading of Fuel into Tanker:  Sparking or explosion may occur when a truck or tanker \\netc carries fuel from one place to another. To prevent this type of danger the tanker should be connected to the ground by a conductor. \\nTelevision and Monitors of Computer:  During the operating period television and \\nmonitor of computer, electrostatic charges are produced. These charges attract the uncharged dust particles thus they become dirty soon. \\nChange of clothes:  Sometimes our wearing clothes may be charged due to the friction \\nwith us. When we change our clothes, there is a possibility of getting light shock as the charges pass to the ground through our body. \\nOperation Theater:  Necessary measures have to be taken to keep the surgeons, \\nconcerned people and treatment equipments of the operation theater in a hospital free from electric charges as they attract dirt and germs. This is why they have to wear \\nconductor shoes of rubber and use rubber gloves. So that electron can pass through them \\nto the ground. \\nHanging metal chain with petrol transporting truck:  A metal chain has to be hung \\ntouching the road with the trucks that carries petrol, diesel or other liquid fuels. When a \\ntruck moves along the road, the petrol in the tank dashes against the inner surface of the tank and oscillates to and fro. As a result of this, friction charge is stored in petrol. If any \\nspark takes place from the edge of the tank it may cause serious accident and may set \\nfire. So the charges in petrol are not safe. Therefore a chain is connected at the back of the tank so that the charge can pass through it to the ground easily as metal is a good \\nconductor. \\nNo direct connection between metal pillar and electric line:  The metal pillars on the \\nroad have no direct connection with electric lines pulled over the pillars. As metals are \\ngood conductors, the electricity of the wire may pass through the pillar to the ground if \\nthe pillar has connection with wires. If anyone touches the pillar he could immediately be electrified causing serious accident. So the wires are connected to the pillars by a \\nporcelain cup. \\nThunder bolt and lightning conductors:  We know that there is water vapor in atmosphere. \\nThis water vapor being condensed on the charged ions on the atmosphere and form water '),\n",

When these water droplets gather together \\ncloud is formed. Cloud can be charged either positively or negatively. When two oppositely \\ncharged clouds come close to each other then  electrical discharge takes place between them \\nand makes huge spark. This is called lightning or electric flash. \\nDuring electric flash the air around the cloud expands suddenly by getting heated. Due to \\nsudden expansion the pressure of the air lowers much. Then neighboring air at higher pressure contracts the expanded air. Due to this sudden expansion and contraction of air, \\nviolent sound is produced. This is known as roaring of thunder. If there is too much \\ncharge on a cloud then it includes opposite charge on the surface of the earth and electric discharge takes place. This is known as thunder bolt. \\nLightning conductor or lightning arrester:  In order to protect buildings \\nfrom the ravage of lightning the lightning conductor is used. The metallic \\nrod R (Fig 10.18) with several sharp points at the top is fixed in such a way \\nthat its upper end extends several feet above the roof of the building and lowers end runs down along the outer surface of the building and buried \\nwell inside the moist earth. \\nWhen a charged cloud passes above the building then the charge of \\nopposite kind is induced in the conductor rod R. The accumulation of \\ncharge is at maximum at the pointed ends of lightning conductor and pointed ends discharges their charge to the air particles around it. The air \\nparticles around the sharp points are charged by conduction and are \\nattracted by the opposite charges of cloud and moves towards the cloud is neutralized. As a result the probability of thunder bolt decreases. \\nElectricity always passes following the shortest path through a conductor. The charge \\nproduced in the clouds tends to reach the earth through the high standing objects. During \\nstorm and rain it is rather good to wet in rain than to stand under an umbrella, any tree, \\nnear any conductor, iron bridge or fence of sharp iron wire. \\nInvestigation:10.1 \\nProduction of the charge in the process of friction and induction. \\nObjectives:  Demonstration of charges produced in the process of friction and induction. \\nApparatus:  Pith ball, glass rod, silk cloth, piece of rubber and a conductor rod. \\nWorking procedure: \\n1.

Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the \\nexistence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is \\nseen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. \\nThe galvanometer’s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this \\nelectric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the \\nnegatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively \\ncharged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the \\ngalvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. \\n11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow \\nWhen current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was \\nproduced due to the flow of positive charge s. This positive charge flows from higher \\npotential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from \\nhigher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric \\ncell. But we know that actually electric curre nt is the flow of negative charges or of \\nelectrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher \\npotential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the \\nactual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current. \\n \\nFigure: 11.2 \\n11.3 Electric symbols  \\nThe complete path through which electric curre nt can flow is called electric circuit. \\nWhen two plates of a cell are joined to the two ends of a resistor or an electric devices an \\nelectric circuit is formed. \\nWe have to draw simple and clear circuit diagrams to study current electricity.

This electric current \\ncan move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all.

Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are \\ncalled conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials.

For example: Plastic, rubber, wood, glass etc. There are no free electrons \\ninside insulating materials. Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. \\nAs a result plastics are insulator for electricity . Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers \\nand pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic.  \\n3. Semiconductor: The materials whose  current conduction capacity lies between that \\nof conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can \\nbe increased by adding suitable impurities.  \\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm’s law \\nWe know, if there is a potential difference be tween the two terminals of a conductor, \\ncurrent flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the \\ntemperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship \\nbetween the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference \\nbetween the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm’s law.  \\nOhm’s law \\nThe current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional \\nto the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor. \\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, \\nthe current flowing through the conductor will be doubled.  Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third.  \\nAssume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are V\\nA and V B \\n[Figure 11.3] respectively. If V A > V B, The potential difference between the two \\nterminals of the conductor will be V = V A - V B.  \\n \\nFigure: 11.3 \\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is  I, then \\naccording to ohm’s law, \\nI ∝ V \\n⇒ VRI= = constant \\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that \\ntemperature.  \\nor, VIR=\\n \\nGraph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4 Fig: 11.14 '),\n",

When the electrons move within the \\nbulk of a conductor, they collide with the atoms and molecules of the conductor. Due to \\nthis their motion is resisted and electric current is obstructed. This property of a conductor is called resistance. \\nAt particular temperature,  \\n                                        Resistance, \\nVRI=\\n \\n                                                 = Potential difference of two ends\\nElectric current \\nThe SI unit for resistance is ohm . It is expressed by the capital letter omega ( Ω). \\n 1 Ω is the resistance of a conductor through which a current of 1A flows when a \\npotential difference of 1 V is applied across it. \\nResistors: A resistor is a conductor used in a circuit that has a known value of \\nresistance. The main objective of using resistor s is to control the quantity of the current \\nflowing in a circuit. There are two types of resistors that are used in a circuit. These are: \\n1. Fixed resistors \\n2. Variable resistors \\n1. Fixed resistors: The fixed resistors are thos e who have fixed values of resistance. The \\nfixed resistors that are generally used  in laboratory are shown in figure 11.5. \\n \\nFigure: 11.5 Here, \\nElectric current, I = 4 A \\nPotential difference, V = 12 V \\nResistance, R=?'),\n",

Variable resistors:   The variable resistors are those whose \\nvalue of the resistance can be changed according to the \\nnecessity. These are called rheostat too. A rheostat is included \\nin a circuit to vary the current flowing through it. Figure 11.6 shows a rheostat commonly used in the laboratories.       \\n11.7 Electromotive force and potential difference \\nElectromotive force Electrical energy is needed to produce elect ric current in a circuit. The electromotive \\nforce of an electrical energy source is defined as the work done by the source or the \\nenergy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit \\nto the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source.  \\nIf the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work \\ndone in bringing 1 C of charge is \\nW\\nQ. Therefore the electromotive force of the source \\nis, WEQ=\\n \\nUnit: The SI unit of electromotive force is JC-1 or volt (V).  \\nThe devices which can transform some other forms of energy into electrical energy they only have electromotive force. For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts \\nchemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into \\nelectrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell. Potential difference: The electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two \\nterminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of \\nwork done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for \\nmigration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of \\nthe bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migr ates between the two points. If W is the \\namount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of \\ncharge, then the potential difference between the two points is  Fig. 11.6 '),\n",

That is \\nvolt (V). The potential difference between the two points will be 1 V if 1 J of electrical \\nenergy is converted to other forms when 1C positive charge flows between the two \\npoints.  \\nExperiment: Measure the potential difference between the two terminals of a dry cell. This is \\nthe electromotive force. Now connect this ce ll to the bulb and again measure the potential \\ndifference between the two terminals of the cell.  \\nThe voltmeter reading is the potential differen ce between the two ends of the bulb or of \\nresistance during the current flow. Now compare the values of the measured electromotive force and potential difference. You will observe that the value of E is \\nlarger than that of V. \\n11.8 Dependence of resistance \\nWe know, when temperature and other physical  conditions (e.g. - length, cross section, \\narea) remain the same, the resistance of a conductor is a constant. The resistance of a conductor depends on four factors. \\n1. Length of the conductor. \\n2. Cross sectional area of the conductor. \\n3. Materials of the conductor and. \\n4. Temperature of the conductor. \\nWe know, if the temperature remains constant, the resistance of a conductor depends \\nonly on its length, area of cross section and the material of the conductor. This \\ndependence of resistance is expressed by two laws. \\nFigure 11.7 shows two conducting wires P and Q with the same cross sectional area and made of the same material. The length of wire P is longer than that of Q. Its resistance is greater as it is longer.  \\n \\nLaw of length:  The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length when \\nthe cross sectional area, material and temperature of the conductor remain the same. If the length of the conductor is L, area of cross section is A, and its resistance is R,   then \\naccording to this law,  Figure: 11.7 '),\n",

The area of cross section of wire S is bigger than the area of cross section of wire T. Larger the area of cross section of a wire, the lower its resistance.  \\nLaw of cross section: The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross \\nsectional area when the length, material and temperature of the conductor remain the same.  \\nThat is, \\nR ∝ 1\\nA  , when temperature, material and L is constant                                 (11.2) \\n11.9 Resistivity and Conductivity \\nAt constant temperature, the resistance of a conductor of particular material varies \\nproportionately with the length and inversely with the area of cross section. Therefore, we get from the laws of resistance, \\nLRA∝  when temperature and material remain the same. \\nor, R =ρ L\\nA                            (11.3) \\nHere ρ is a constant, the value of which depends on the material of the conductor and its \\ntemperature. This constant is called the resis tivity or specific resistance of the material at \\nthat temperature.  In equation (11.3), if L=1 unit, A=1 unit, then, \\nRρ=.  \\nTherefore, at a particular temperature, the resistance of a conductor of unit length and unit cross sectional area is called the specific resistance of that material at that temperature.   At a certain temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends on its physical conditions (e.g. length, cross section etc.). But the resistivity of a conductor depends only on its material.   \\nUnit of specific resistance:  Rewriting equation (11.3) we can write,  \\nρ = R  A\\nL                                                                                                                                           (11.4) \\nSubstituting the units of the quantities on the right side of the equation, the unit of ρ is  \\n2mmmΩ=Ω '),\n",

Besides, materials with higher resistivities also have multiple uses. One example is the \\nnichrome wire. The resistivity and melting point of nichrome is much higher than that of \\ncopper. Due to the high resistivity of nichrome, a lot of thermal energy is produced when a current flows through it. This property of nichrome causes water to boil very quickly in \\nelectric kettle. The filament of electric bulbs that are used in our houses is made of \\ntungsten. Tungsten can convert electrical energy to light and thermal energy owing to its high resistivity and melting point. \\nConductivity \\nThe reciprocal quantity of resistance is called conductance.

This \\nelectrical energy may be transformed into different forms of energy (e.g.- heat, light, \\nmechanical energy etc.) according to the nature of the circuit.  \\n \\nFigure 11.13 \\nSay, AB is a conductor of resistance R and Q amount of charge is flowing through it. \\nThe potential difference between the points A and B is V. We know, if the potential \\ndifference between the two terminals of a conductor is 1 volt and 1 coulomb charge flows through it, then the amount of work done or energy spent is 1joule.  Now, if Q \\ncoulomb charge flows through the conductor, the amount of work done =  VQ joule. \\nTherefore, energy spent or the amount of energy converted is                                                          \\nWV Q=  \\nAgain, electric current,                   QIt=  \\n                                                   or, QI t= \\n                                                 ∴  WV I t=                                (11.11) \\nUsing ohm’s law this relationship can be expressed as below, \\n                             ∴    2\\n2 VWV I tI R t tR== =   Joule                       (11.12) \\nElectric power \\nThe electric appliances which we use in houses or in offices are generally marked with \\nthe voltage by which it runs and the electric power in watt.

In the calculations of electric energy generally \\nkW, MW etc. are used instead of watt. 1 kW=103 W and 1 MW=106 W. \\nThe power of some of the electric appliances which we use in our houses is mentioned \\nbelow. The power of an electric bulb is generally 40, 60 and 100 W.  The power of an electric fan is found to 65-75 W commonly. Power of a television is generally 60-70 W. The energy saving bulbs which we use now-a-days has power of 11-30 W. \\nBesides this, we use refrigerator, heater, iron etc. in houses- their power is more. So, it is \\ncommended not to use these appliances during peak hour. \\nCalculation of electrical energy spent We have to pay for the electrical energy we utilize in our houses, shops, mills and \\nfactories. There is an electricity meter in the houses those use electricity, which maintain \\nthe accounts of spent electrical energy. Throughout the world, the electricity supply authority measures the amount of electrical energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hour (kWh). We call this kilowatt-hour unit as ‘board of trade’ unit or in brief ‘unit’. From the difference of the readings of two times in the electricity meter, we get the amount of consumed electric power during this period. \\nSince power, P = \\nWork done\\ntime = Converted energy\\ntime \\n                                           W\\nt=   \\n                                ∴   WP t=   \\nIf P=1 kW and t =1h, then W=1 kW×1h=1 kWh. \\nTherefore, the amount of electrical energy converted or spent when an electric device of \\n1 kilowatt power works for 1 hour is called 1 kilowatt-hour or 1 unit. \\nDo yourself: Express 1kWh in terms of joule. \\n1 kWh = 3.6× 106 J \\nWhen power is expressed in watt and time in hour, the amount of electrical energy \\nconsumed can be expressed as: \\n                                                     WP t=  Wh \\nDividing this by 1000, the electricity consumed is found to be in kWh.

The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different substations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again.  \\nIn the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low \\nvoltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmissi on have a definite amount of resistance. As \\na result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This  loss of energy is termed as system loss. \\nDue to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the \\ni2R loss of the power grid \\nbecomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss.

The electricity \\ngenerated by all the power stations is added in the national power grid. According to the \\ndemand of different locality power sub-stations  collect electricity from the national grid. \\nThen the power sub-station delivers or distributes the electricity to the consumer level.  \\nWhen in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the \\npower sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in \\nsome parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub-\\nstation gets the supply according to its dema nd, then it distributes electricity in that \\nregion again.   \\nIf the load shedding takes place for a couple of  hours continuously, authority load sheds \\ncircularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level.  \\n11.14 Safe and effective use of electricity \\nDangers of electricity \\nElectricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful \\nto us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people. \\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below. \\n1. Damaged insulation \\n2. Overheating of the cables \\n3. Damped conditions \\n1. Damaged insulation:  \\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two \\nconducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.  \\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical \\ncables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.  \\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large \\ncurrent flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual '),\n",

Besides this, we make connection of too many \\nelectrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire \\nconnected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation \\nis melted and causes fire.   \\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may \\noccur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass \\nthrough water. The parts of an electric appliance which are \\nnot insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a \\nhair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using \\nthe sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged.  Besides this, switching on or off of \\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky. \\nSafe use of electricity  In the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the   \\npresent section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity. \\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed: 1. Circuit breaker \\n2. Fuses \\n3. Correct connection of switch \\n4. Earth wire \\n1. Circuit breaker  \\nCircuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of \\na house. Circuit breaker switches off the electri cal supply in a circuit when there is an \\noverflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of \\nthe house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.  \\n2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent \\nexcessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the \\nelectric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit \\nis disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher \\ncurrent than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If \\nthe fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.  Figure: 11.14 '),\n",

Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit. \\nDuring switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be \\nfitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source \\nfrom the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be ‘live’ even if the switch is ‘off’ [Figure 11.16] \\nand increase the risk of electric shock. \\n \\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16 \\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a \\ncomplete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the \\nelectrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply \\nthrough the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is  usually connected to the metallic casing of \\nthe appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not \\nproperly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. \\nIn this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal \\ncasing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. \\nIt is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe \\nuse of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be \\nrisky. How earth wire works as a safety  precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18. \\n \\nFigure 11.17 and 11.18 Live wire (L) \\nLive wire (L) \\nNeutral wire (N) '),\n",

What is happening to the needle of compass? \\nWe see that the needle is moving to one side after switching \\non the current on circuit. If we alter the electric connection, the needle of the compass will move the other side.

If we stop the current, it will not remain magnet. If the direction of current is changed, the pole of magnet will be changed. Through this process, the iron is turned into magnet which is called electromagnet. \\n  Figure: 12.1 \\nFigure: 12.2 \\nFigure: 12.3 '),\n",

Electromagnet. \\nIf we insert any iron rod through the solenoid, we can \\nget more powerful magnetic field that the solenoid \\nhas. During the flow of current, it is converted into more powerful magnet. This is called electromagnet. \\nThe intensity of this magnet can be increased - \\n-by increasing the flow of current  - by increasing the number of coil of the solenoid \\n- by bending the iron rod in the form of alphabet U and keeping two ends of U as close \\nas possible . \\nNow examine with the help of your teacher, how much paper clips or alpines are \\nattracted by the magnetic iron rod for the flow of various current or for increasing the \\nnumbers of turn of the solenoid coil. Electromagnet is used to make the electric bell, to carry the heavy load up and down made by steel or iron or to make crane which is used \\nto remove the rubbish. This magnet is used to remove the dust of iron from the eye. \\nBesides, this magnet is also used as earpiece of telephone and lock of magnetic door. \\n12.5. Electromagnetic Induction \\nMany scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested \\ninvented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia \\nachieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his \\nexperiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. The phenomena to produce \\nelectric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic \\ninduction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. \\nExperiment-1 : An insulated wire is wound over a card \\nboard cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the \\npresence of electric current. You have to open the non \\nconducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil. \\nWhat’s happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is \\ntaking place. It means the current is flowing through the coil. Now remove the magnet. What’s happening? The \\ndeflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to \\nthe coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away fr om the magnet. If the coil is moved away \\nfrom the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side. Figure: 12.3 a \\nFigure: 12.4 '),\n",

A galvanometer is to be connected with the first coil. In the second coil, a battery, \\na rheostat and a tapping key are to be connected [12.5a]. The coil which is connected to \\nthe sources of emf is called the primary coil and which is connected to the galvanometer is called secondary coil. When the current is switched on in the primary coil, the \\ndeflection of galvanometer will be seen for a moment in the secondary coil [12.5b]. \\nAgain the deflection of galvanometer will be seen at the time of disconnecting the electric current but the deflection will be opposite to the direction of former. \\n If the current is continuously varied in th e primary coil, the galvanometer will show the \\ndeflections. In this case, the direction in which the galvanometer will deflect during rise of current is opposite to that during fall of current. Keeping the current fixed in the \\nprimary coil a variation of the distance between the two coils will produce a momentary \\ndeflection of the galvanometer. The direction of deflection due to increase of distance is opposite to that due to reduction in distance between the coils. \\n \\n           Figure: 12.5 a      Figure: 12.5 b \\n12.6. Induced current and induced voltage \\nFrom these two experiments, it is observed that the deflection of the galvanometer \\nproves the existence of an emf. So if we move a magnet towards or away from the the coil or if we move a coil towards or away from a magnet, the electric current will be produced there. This is called electromagnetic induction. If we move a coil towards or away from electric circuit or electric wire, the electric current will be produced there also. This is also called electromagnetic induction. So we can say that the process of creating electric current through the change of the distance of the circuit which can create voltage temporarily to another closed  circuit is called electromagnetic induction. \\nThis voltage is known as induced voltage and the current is known as induced current. If there have no relative motion between magnet and coil, the deflection will not be seen. The more will be the relative motion, the more will be the deflection. So it is said that how long the relative motion will last between magnet and coil, induced current will be durable for that period. If the pole of magnet is altered, the side of induced current will be altered. Induced current and induced voltage can be created in the following way- \\n-by increasing the polar power of magnet '),\n",

Effect of magnet on current carrying wire \\nWe know that current carrying wire produced a magnetic \\nfield of its own. There happens action and reaction \\nbetween magnetic field exsisting inside the opposite pole \\nof a powerful magnet and the magnetic field of current carrying wire. \\n Your teacher can show you the action and reaction. You \\ncan do it yourself or with the help of your teacher.  \\nPut an electric wire between the two poles of a powerful \\nmagnet like the picture. Let the electricity flow through \\nthis wire. You will see that it will jump to th e up. It is understood that a force is working \\non that. From where does this come? \\nIf you look at the picture 12.7(a), you will see th e lines of force between the poles of the \\nmagnet. The magnetic field created by electric current has also been shown. The lines of force created from the combination of two fields has also been shown in the picture \\n12.7(b). The lines of force are more in the down than that of the up of the wire. The \\nreason is that both the fields are working towards the same direction. [Again see the picture 12.7(a)].The fields above the wire ar e opposing each-other, some lines of force \\nare rejecting one-another. As a result the number of lines is less there. As the line wants \\nto keep themselves very tight to each other (like elastic rubber), they apply upward force on the wire. \\n \\n   Figure: 12.7 a                                   Figure: 12.7 b \\nIf the wire remains free, it moves upward. If the direction of electric current is changed to opposite, the wire goes to downward.  \\n12.8. Electric motor: \\nSuppose a loop or coil of wire like picture 12.8(a) is used between the two poles of \\nmagnet .As the loop has returned to the opposite direction from A to B, the opposite electricity will flow between the two half of the loop or coil. So, the wire will go to the \\nupward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical \\nposition of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two Figure: 12.6 '),\n",

Each segment is connected to A and B \\nrespectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric \\nsource through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its’ gap \\nbetween two side remains opposite to the car bon brush, no current will flow. But despite \\nthis fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly \\nwhen it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain \\ncontinue. \\n \\n         Figure:12.8 a,                         Figure: 12.8 b \\nIt is noticeable that though A and B have changed their position, the comutator  current will enter from the right side of the loop like before and will come out from the left, (see the figure 12.9) and the coil will rotate clockwis e. This is the principle of electric motor. \\nElectric motor converted the electric energy into mechanical energy. To increase the \\nspeed and power of it, the intensity pf the magnetic field will have to increase. \\nThe intensity of the of the magnetic field can be increased in \\nmany ways. These are – \\n-By increasing the electric current.  -By increasing the number of turn in the loop or coil. \\n-By using powerful magnet.  \\n-By increasing length and width of the coil.                                               The electric motor that we use also works in the same way. \\nBut extra parts will have to add to increase the power and flexibility of the rotation. \\nMany coils or loops are made instead of only one coil or loop and they are arranged neatly around the central axis or orbit. Each of these wires is connected to its \\ncommutator. It helps to move continuously and \\neasily.  \\nEach of coils is made of hundred scrape on the soft \\nrod of iron (which is called armature).For this, the \\narmature is magnetized during current flow and increase the intensity of the magnetic field.

Generator  \\nThe electric machine in which mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy is \\ncalled generator. The basic principals of this machine are established on the basis of electromagnetic induction. Generator can be of two kinds. Such as  \\n1) AC generator \\n2) DC generator 1. AC generator: The structure and functions of it are being discussed in the following as \\nit is widely used: \\nStructure :  There is a field-magnet NS in it. There is \\nrectangular coil of wire in the middle of the magnet on the soft \\nsheet of iron (AB). The iron sheet is called armature. The \\narmature is rotated at the uniform speed in mechanical way on the middle of the magnet. The two sides of the rectangular coil \\nare connected to two slip rings.  \\nThe two slip rings can rotate to same orbit of armature. The \\ntwo carbon brushes are set in such a way that they touch the \\ntwo slip rings when the armature is being rotated. The \\nresistance R of external circuit is connected to the brushes. \\nFunctions:  When the armature undergoes rotation, the armature coil intersect the lines \\nof force of the magnetic field and the electromotive force is induced in the coil according \\nto electromagnetic induction. As the two sides of the coil are connected to the external circuit a alternating current is develop in th e circuit. The magnitude of induced current \\nmainly depends on the intensity and speed of the rotation of the magnetic field. During \\none complete rotation of the coil the direction of the induced curent is changed once. Thus the alternating current is produced from the mechanical energy. \\n12.10. Transformer : \\nThe electrical device through which the high alternating potential can be changed into \\nlow alternating potential and low potential into high potential is called transformer. This \\ndevice is made on the basis electromagnetic induction. There are two kinds of \\ntransformers. \\n These are - \\n1. Step up Transformer:  The   transformer which converts an electric current of greater \\nstrength at a low voltage into an electric current of weaker value at high voltage is known as step up transformer. \\n2. Step down Transformer:  The transformer which changes the high potential less \\nelectric current into low potential much electric current is step down transformer. Figure: 12.11 '),\n",

The coil in which an a.c \\nor emf is induced is known as secondary coil. In step up transformer the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil. In step down transformer the \\nnumber of turns in the secondary is less than that in the primary coil. \\n \\n Let an a.c emf E p be applicd to a primary coil n p turns. A current I p flows in this coil. \\nThis curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately \\nproduces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associ ated with each turn of the sccondary coil. \\nConsequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the \\nsecondary coil be n\\ns and the induced emf be E s, \\nWe have: Ep\\nEs =  np\\nns                       12.1 \\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns. \\nFor a step up transformer n s > n p and for a step down transformer n s < n p. If no energy is \\ndissipated in the transformer core, the energy input to the primary coil is wholly \\ntransferred to the secondary coil. \\nTherefore, voltage of the primary coil x current of primary coil = Voltage of secondary coil x current of secondary coil \\ni.c. \\nEp Ip = E s Is \\nTherefore, Ep\\nEs = Is\\nIp               12.2 \\nThis equation suggests that the rate at which a transformer reduces the voltage is exactly \\nequal to the rate at which it increase the current so that the total power remains constant. \\nTherefore, a transformer transforms both the voltage and the current. For transmission of electric power over long distances step up transformer is used. Step \\ndown transformer is used for domestic power supply such as radio, television, tape \\nrecorder, VCR, VCP, electric watch etc.   Figure: 12.12 a                      Fi gure: 12.12 b'),\n",

Radioactivity \\nIn 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special \\npenetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a \\ncontinuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nucl ear event. This event is a spontaneous and \\ncontinuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature.  Any manmade external \\ninfluences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or \\ndecrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her \\nhusband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar \\ntype of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon \\nof emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. \\nRadioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the \\nRadium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The \\nunit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel.  \\n13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays \\nAlpha particle:  Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two \\nneutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric \\nfield. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. \\nThe mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2×10\\n-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold \\nleaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The \\nvelocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. \\nBeta particle:  These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic \\nand electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up \\nto 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e.  9.11×10-31kg. Its existence can be \\ndetected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce \\nfluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The \\nmotion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. \\nGamma rays:  These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of \\nshort wavelength. It has no mass. It is not de flected by electric and magnetic field. Its \\nspeed is same to that of light, which means 3×10\\n8 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very \\nhigh. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its \\nionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger–Müller counter. '),\n",

Half–life of a radioactive element \\nWe can’t say which atom of a radioactive element will decay and when it will take place. \\nBut we can calculate how many atoms will deca y in a particular time. A cluster of atoms \\nis considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total \\nnumber of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life,  the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus \\nit will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. \\n13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in me dical science, agriculture and industries. In \\nmedical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the resear ch to produce special type of fertilizer \\nnecessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases.  \\nThe hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This \\nhappens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a resu lt they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to \\ndetermine the age or time of things of millions year old. \\n13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although  radioactivity is beneficial to  us, it can be very \\ndangerous also. The high dose of  radioactive radiation can create serious problems in \\nhuman body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation. '),\n",

Radio, television, phone, fax, camera, computer, \\nwatch etc. are the contributions of electronics. The control of electric current through \\nvacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of \\nelectronics is ancient of more than hundred y ears. The real journey of electronics begins \\nwith the invention of Addison’s effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric \\nlamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. Th e positive end of the filament of carbon of \\nthe lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by \\nsealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate \\nwith respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison \\nexplains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes \\nto the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as \\nAddison effect. British physicist Fleming fi rst invented the vacuum tube by using \\nAddison effect. This tube works as a rectifie r that means it changes alternating current to \\ndirect current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was \\nvery necessary for Marconi’s Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there \\nwere two electrodes in it, this is called diode.  \\nAfter two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called \\ntriode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, \\nthere was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier. So triode \\nplays a vital role in the development of communication.            \\n \\nFigures diode and triode \\nAs the size of diode and triode valves are very large, they create problem to fix them in \\ndifferent electronic devices. The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool . So the scientists were searching for a \\nsemiconductor device as its alternative. Later they invented p-n junction diode. After \\nlong experiments, they were able to invent n-p-n transistor. Transistor works as an amplifier. '),\n",

Sometimes it \\nbecomes impossible. So, IC or integrated circuit is invented. IC is such a creation using \\nsemiconductors like silicon, where millions of microscopic electric circuits are gathered \\nin a place like a nail of our finger. Revolutiona ry changes took place in the design of IC \\nchips after its invention in 1960. \\n13.7. Analogue and Digital electronics \\nAnalogue signal:  The magnitude of some quantity which changes continuously is called \\nanalogue. The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure \\ncan be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. \\nTelephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data. \\nSo the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or \\ncurrent is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the \\nhighest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave. Audio and video voltages are the example of analogue signals. \\n \\nFigure 13.1: Analogue signal                                    Figure 13.2: Digital signal   \\nDigital signal:  Generally the word ‘digit’ means number. The word ‘digital’ comes from \\nthe word digit. Digital signal means such a communicative signal which can receive \\nsome definite value. These can be changed into discrete values and each of them can be identified separately. In this system, with the help of binary code i.e. 0 and 1, any \\ninformation, number, letter or any special si gnal etc. can be understood or sent. In this \\nsignal system, the value of ‘on’ state is 1 and the value of ‘off’ state is 0. \\n \\nFigure 13.3: transformation of analogue signal to a digital signal \\nComputer saves, process and sends any data as digital signal. With help of modem, analogue data can be changed into digital and digital data can be changed into analogue \\ndata. Analogue clock shows the time by continuous rotation of the hands and digital \\nclock gives the time by changing the digits. \\nAdvantages and disadvantages of analogue and digital signal \\nWhich one is better between analogue and digital signal can be measured by three \\nfactors. These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense. '),\n",

If the distance is long, the \\npower of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, \\namplification has to be done. As a result noi se increases, and the quality of the signal is \\nreduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal \\nthrough an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains \\nunchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than \\nthat of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it \\ncannot be happened in digital system. \\n13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit  \\nSemiconductor:  There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are \\nneither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it \\nbehaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased \\nby adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p-type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are \\ndenoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of   \\nphosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous \\natoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in \\nthe substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the \\nexample of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the \\nelectronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping \\nwithin the material. \\nIf an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type \\nmaterial, a very necessary device is developed which is \\ncalled a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode \\nmakes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct \\ncurrent (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be \\nelectrified due to faulty connection. \\nIt is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The \\ninstrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device \\nwhich works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is \\nintroduced between two n-type materials like a \\nsandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and \\ncollector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Figure 13.4: Diode and its symbol  \\nFig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol  '),\n",

Here p-\\ntype regions are the collector and emitter and n-type region is the base.  \\nTransistor is used to amplify the electric current. Integrated circuit:  Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of \\nthe electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we \\nsee around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. \\nRevolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960.  \\nAt the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in \\ncomputers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of \\ncomponents which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of \\ncomponents is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the \\ndevices is being developed. \\nIf the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like \\nmobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a \\nrevolution and given us many facilities and comforts.  \\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker \\nMicrophone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his \\nspeech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly \\nthrough a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone \\ninto sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, \\nVCR etc. \\nMicrophone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into \\nelectrical audio wave or signal. The frequenc y and relative amplitude of the electrical \\naudio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named \\ndiaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks \\nthrough a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is \\ndesigned to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. \\nThe vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm  \\nmove to and fro in the magnetic field.  As a result, \\nFig: 13.6 Microphone'),\n",

Thus microphone converts the \\nsound energy into electrical energy. This is called audio signal. Having amplified, this \\nelectric audio signal can be transferred to a long distance through a telephone line or \\nradio. So microphone plays a vital role in television and radio broadcasting, recording and telephone.  \\nSpeaker:  Speaker does just the opposite task of the microphone. \\nSpeaker converts the electric signal of microphone into corresponding sound wave. \\nFunctions of speaker : Most of the loudspeakers are moving coil \\nloudspeaker. It has- \\n1. A cylindrical permanent magnet which produces a strong \\nmagnetic field. \\n2. A small coil or wire-loop is suspended. This wire-loop can oscillate to and fro in the \\nmagnetic field. \\n3. A paper cone remains attached with wire-loop. \\nWhen the alternating current produced by the sound flows through the loop, the loop \\nmoves to and fro. For this reason, the paper cone is vibrated. As a result, sound is \\nproduced.  \\n13.10 Information and communication technology At present, information and communication technology is a very popular subject. \\nStarting from simple works of our daily life we can do very important tasks of our \\nprofessional life by using information and communication technology easily. Communications have greatly influenced the life of human being at the beginning of 20\\nth \\nand 21st century. In 19th century, the development and expansion of telephone and \\ntelegraph has taken communication power of human one step forward. In 20th century \\nradio, television, cell-phone, fax-machine have brought a revolution in the field of \\ncommunication. After these, computer and internet have made great contribution to the \\ndevelopment of communication. \\nRadio:  Radio is a wide and important medium of entertainment \\nand communication. We can hear news, song, music, drama, \\ndiscussion, debate and the advertisements of industrial products. Radio is used to exchange information in army and police \\ndepartment. Radio technology is used in the field of mobile or \\ncellular phone communication. The scientists who have made a great contribution to invent radio are Googlielmo Marcony of \\nItaly and Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose of Bikrampur in Bangladesh.         \\nWe can hear sound from radio. How is this sound sent and how can we hear it? In the \\nstudio of a radio-telecast station, a person speaks before the microphone. Microphone Fig: 13.7  \\nFig: 13.8  '),\n",

This wave is known as audio signal. The \\nfrequency or power of this signal is very weak and its frequency range is 20 hertz to 20000 hertz. This wave cannot go far. So this information carrying low frequency wave is mixed with high frequency electromagnetic wave. This high frequency electromagnetic wave is called carrier wave. This combined wave is called modulated wave. The process of mixing these two waves is called modulation. This modulated wave is also called radio wave. Radio wave is amplified with the help of an amplifier and transmitted to space as electromagnetic wave with the help of antenna of the transmitter. This radio wave spreads out in  the space and it is divided into two waves \\ncalled Ground wave and Sky wave. Ground wa ve directly reaches to the aerial of \\nreceiver. The radio set in our house is a ra dio wave receiver. The sky wave comes back \\nto the earth by being reflected at the ionosphere and is received by Ariel of the receiver. \\nThe receiver receives the radio wave and conve rts into electrical signal. After that the \\nsound wave is separated from the carrier wave by the process of demodulation. Later electrical signal is amplified with the help of amplifier and is sent to loudspeaker. Loudspeaker again changes the electrical signal into sound. We can hear this sound. \\nSo, the sound is not transmitted from the transm itter to the radio. The sound wave is sent \\nby changing it into electromagnetic wave, the receiver receives the radio wave, the loudspeaker changes it into sound. \\n \\nFigure: 13.9 \\nTelevision:  Television is such a device by which we can hear the sound and watch the \\npicture of the speakers on the screen from distant place. \\nIn 1926, Logy Beard was able to send pictures on television. On that day, the TV actor \\nwas a talking doll.  \\n \\nFigure: 13.10 '),\n",

To send the sound and picture on television, there are separate \\ntransmitters in the transmitting station by which sound and picture can be sent in the \\nform of electromagnetic wave.  \\n \\nFigure: 13.10 \\nPictures are transformed into electrical signals and then sent with the help of one of the \\ntransmitters. With the help of another transmitter pictures are transformed into electrical \\nsignals and then transmitted them in the form of electromagnetic wave. At first we \\nshould discuss about sending and receiving picture.  The pictures or the scenery   are to be sent has to be converted into electrical signals by the TV camera. This signal is mixed \\nwith a high frequency carrier in the modulation process.  Afterwards it is sent in the form \\nof electromagnetic radio wave with the help of an antenna. \\nTV set receives electromagnetic carrier wave for the picture with the help of antenna.  \\nRectifier separates video electrical signal from the carrier wave. This electrical signal is \\namplified by an amplifier and it is sent to the electron gun. This electron gun is attached to the back of the picture tube of the te levision. After receiving the video signal, the \\nelectron gun shoots the narrow electron beam like a needle. When the electron beam \\nfrom the electron gun incidents on the fluorescent phosphor screen of the TV, then flash of light is created. With the combination of these bright and dark spots, bright and dark \\nlight spots and flashes are created on the TV screen. The picture sent from the camera is \\nseen on the TV screen with the combination of these bright and dark spots. This forms 25 still picture on the TV screen in every second which our eyes see as moving picture. \\nTransmitting and receiving of sound \\nThe picture which will be sent to television and the sound associated are converted into \\nelectrical signal with the help of microphone. This electric wave is mixed with a high \\nfrequency electromagnetic wave known as carrier wave and it is transmitted with the \\nhelp of transmitter. \\nThe TV set that we use in our house has separate processes of receiving sound and \\npicture signal.

This electric current reaches the receiver of \\ntelevision set passing through the wires. The sound receiving receiver of the television \\nset receives this electrical signal and amplifies it. Later it is sent to the loudspeaker \\nwhich converts this electrical signal into original sound .We can hear this sound. \\nGenerally these are the functions of black and white television. \\nColour television:  There are no major differences between the basic principles of colour \\nTV and Black and White TV. There are three separate electron guns in the camera of colour television for three basic colours (Red, Blue and Green) .There are also three \\nelectron guns in the receiving machine of colour television. The screen of colour \\ntelevision is made of three kinds of phosphor granules. A particular colour illuminates the phosphor granules of that particular colour. Consequently, the screen of a television \\ntube gives red, blue and green light spots. Hence the coloured image becomes visible on \\nthe TV screen. \\nTelephone \\nIntroduction:  Telephone is the largest, most widely used and popular medium of \\ncommunication in the world. It is used to communicate, send E-mail, Fax, and for computer communication etc. with any other country. \\nAlexander Graham Bell invented Telephone in 1875. Through many evolutions, the \\ntelephone invented by Graham Bell has reached  to the modern dimensions and cordless, \\ncellular and mobile-phone has been made.  \\nHow does telephone work \\nIn every telephone set, there is a system of receiving and \\ntransmitting signal. The mouthpiece of a telephone is microphone, \\nit is the transmitter and the ear-piece is a speaker, and is the \\nreceiver. There is a ringer for making the ringing sound and a dialing system in a telephone set. When we speak, the microphone \\nof the mouthpiece converts our voice into electrical signal. This \\nsignal reaches to the ear-piece of another telephone through the telephone wire. The speaker of the earpiece converts the electrical \\nsignal into sound. As a result, the caller or the called person can \\nhear the sound and answer. This answer of the called person returns to the telephone set of the caller after being \\nconverted into electrical signal with the help of \\nmicrophone of the mouthpiece and it is transformed into sound in the speaker of the earpiece of the caller, \\nthen the caller hears the speech of the called person. \\nThe electrical signal travels so fast through the telephone wire that it does not delay any single \\nmoment to transfer.  Every telephone set is connected Figure: 13.11 Land and \\nmobile telephone \\nFigure: 13.11 Function of land telephone '),\n",

The connection with other telephone set is \\nestablished through the regional head-office.                                      \\nCell phone or mobile phone:  Cell phone or Mobile phone is the most popular and \\nwidely used medium of communication of present time.  You can not only communicate with other but also, can play games, download music, songs, hear music, watch film and \\nuse internet with the help of it. Besides, you can make cash payment, pay bill, check in \\nat the airport and apply for the admission in a college or university using this phone. You can communicate from one corner of the country to another over phone. \\nMaking and receiving phone call in Mobile:   \\nThis phone is not connected to another phone with wire. \\nThis type of phone sends and receives information or \\nspeech with the help of radio signal instead of wire. A \\nmobile set is connected to the telephone network through dialing to other mobile sets from the keyboard of one set. \\nWhen you make a call from a mobile from anywhere, the \\ncall travels to the transmitter-receiver tower as a radio wave. \\nThen the call travels to the mobile switch station through \\nmicro wave or wire. This station sends this call to the local telephone exchange. There the call reaches to the called person as a telephone call. Most \\nof the mobile phones at present work with the combination of sending radio wave and \\ntelephone circuit switching. \\nFax:  Fax is the short form of facsimile. It is used to send a document as it is, without \\nany change.                                       \\nWhat is Fax:  Fax is such an electronic system through which any information, picture \\ndiagram or writing can be sent by copying it as it is. Any original document can be \\nreproduced with the help of this machine. \\nThough the fax machine was invented in 1842, its journey started in 1930.The scientist \\nAlexander Bain invented fax.  \\n Figure: 13.13 Mobile Network  \\nFigure: 13.14 Sending document\\nby fax machine '),\n",

The word computer means calculator. It is not only a calculating machine but also more \\nthan that. Computer is such an electronic device that can receive, process, transform, \\npreserve and send any data. All the computers are controlled by the programmed command which tells the computer what it will have to do. \\n \\nFigure: 13.15 Computer \\nStructure of computer \\nComputer is a developed electronic system. Computer collects data, process it according \\nto command and represents results as necessary. Where the computer receives \\ninformation is called Input. Here the data of the computer is applied.

Theories and methods of physical science are employed in \\nbiophysics to study a system of biology. Biology is the science of studying living world. How plants and animals collect food, communicate, percept from the environment and \\nreproduce are discussed in biology. On the other hand the mathematical rule which \\nnature follows is the subject-matter of physics. For a long period, the scientists believed that the laws of living world and physical world are different. But with the progress of \\nphysical and biological science, a deep harmony is found between these two apparently \\ndifferent disciplines. At first physics and biology has evolved as two different subjects. The mutual relationship and coordination between these two subjects has increased a lot \\nwith the advancement of science. It was thought before that living world follows a \\ndifferent rule and the laws of physical science are applicable only for the inanimate objects. But now we know that the animal body can be compared to a machine from \\nmany aspects and it is possible to explain many behaviors of animal body with the help \\nof physical laws. Actually, the laws of physics are universal. So, not only the physical world, but also the animal kingdom can be explained with the help of physics in many \\ncases. This is the basis of bio-physics. \\nThe challenge of bio-physics is to explain different complexities of life on the basis of \\nsimple laws of physics. Bio-physics is a powerful tool to reach at the depth of life by \\ninvestigating different secrets of life and analyzing different events using mathematics \\nand physics. Bio-physics is a bridge between biology and physics.   \\n14.2 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose \\nAcharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist. In our sub-\\ncontinent he is the first internationally recognized scientist. Bose family hailed  from the village Rarikhal of Bikrampur under district of Dhaka. He was born in Mymensingh on \\n30\\nth November, 1958. His father Bhagawan Chandra Bose was a deputy magistrate in \\nthe district of Faridpur. Bose’s education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier’s school and college in Kolkata and \\npassed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the \\nyear 1880.  His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from \\nUniversity of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency \\nCollege. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his \\nresearch work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how \\nradio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place \\nwithout wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro-\\nwave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated '),\n",

He was the first to use a semiconductor junction \\nto detect radio signal. Instead of taking commercial benefit from this invention, he \\nopened it for all, so that others can develop this research more.  \\nSubsequently, Jagadish Chandra Bose made a number of \\nimportant and pioneering discoveries in plant \\nphysiology. Among these, invention of crescograph to \\nrecord the growth of plants, extremely slight movement and how plants respond to various stimuli are notable.      \\nHis major contribution in the field of bio-physics is the \\nnature of conduction of the stimuli in plants. Earlier it was thought that, the nature of response of plants to \\ndifferent stimuli is chemical, but he became able to show \\nthat it is electric in nature.  \\nIn 1917 he established ‘Bose Biggan Mandir’ in Kolkata \\nin order to research about plant physiology. His writings \\nin Bengali language are compiled in a book named ‘Abyakta’. ‘Response in the Living and Non-Living’ is a mentionable book of him. \\nJagadish Chandra Bose expired dated on 23\\nrd November 1937.  \\n14.3 Human body and machine We use different types of devices to meet our various needs of everyday life such as-\\nautomobiles, refrigerator, television, steam engine, internal combustion engine etc. \\nMany people designated  human body as a machine. Though human body is not a \\nmachine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also \\nmade up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities \\nof the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs.  \\nEach organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its \\nown individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most \\ncomplicated man-made machines.  \\nHeart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is \\nactually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body \\nby its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a \\nspecial filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body \\nremains active.  \\nHuman body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In \\ndifferent engines using fuels like petrol, di esel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy \\ninto mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into '),\n",

Therefore, human body is \\nlike an organic machine in fact. But, in many aspects, human body is more amazing than \\nthe most complex machine made by humans. Human body can perform such functions \\nwhich is not possible for any machine. For instance- human body develops from only one cell. With the passage of time, this single cell transforms into a complete human \\nbody, which is build with thousand billions  of cells. But this doesn’t happen in case of \\nany machine. Sometimes functions of the whole body stops due to infirmity of only one part of the body. For example- when function of the heart stops, functions of all other \\nparts of the body stops too, and functions of the brain also stops very quickly. \\n14.4 Instruments used for diagnosis of diseases Once the doctors were used to identifying diseases by observing different external \\nsymptoms of the patients and prescribed medicine and diet accordingly. Modern \\ninstruments to identify diseases were not inve nted at that time. As a result, it was not \\npossible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a \\nparticular organ of the patient is infected  was not possible to know. Various types of \\ninstruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly. It \\nis impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is \\nnecessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of  different devices. Once people used to \\nbelieve different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, \\nthe mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. \\nIn this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of \\ndiseases are discussed.  \\nX-ray \\n X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser \\nthan that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10\\n-10 m. X-ray was invented by \\nWilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of \\nRoentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power \\nof X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an \\nopaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. \\nOn the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the \\nglass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of \\ntungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high \\npotential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with '),\n",

Due to this, the motion of electrons suddenly \\nstops and X-ray is produced. Here, the kinetic energy of electrons transforms into \\nelectromagnetic wave. This radiation of small wavelength is the X-ray. Therefore, if \\nelectrons with high speed strike a metal, then a type of radiation of unknown nature having high penetrating power and of very small wavelength is produced from the metal. \\nThis radiation is called is called X-ray. In figure 14.1 the essential parts of an X-ray tube \\nare shown. \\n \\n      Figure: 14.1              Figure: 14.2 \\nX-ray is used for various purposes. It has tremendous contributions to diagnose diseases \\nin medical science. \\n1. Displaced bones, cracks in bone, bone fracture etc. can be identified very easily with \\nthe help of X-ray.  \\n2. X-ray can be used to diagnose any type of disease in face, for example- to identify \\nulcer and decay at the root of tooth X-ray is used.  \\n3. Intestinal obstruction can be identified by X-ray of abdomen. \\n4. The stones present in the gall bladder and kidneys can be identified by X-ray. \\n5. The diseases of lungs like pneumonia; lung cancer etc. can be traced by X-ray of \\nchest.  \\n6. X-ray is also used for treatment purpose. It can kill cancer cells. Cancer can be \\ntreated using radiotherapy. Necessary precautions should be taken so that unnecessary exposure of X-ray radiation cannot harm the patient. For this, the patient should be covered with apron made of lead as much as possible. X-ray of abdomen and pelvic region of pregnant women should not be done except in case of emergency. Apron made of lead must be used for other X-ray tests.  '),\n",

When sound wave of high frequency is reflected from an organ or muscle \\nwithin the body, then an image analogous to that organ is formed in the monitor by the reflected waves.  \\nThe frequency of the ultrasound is 1-10 MHz whic h is used for diagnosis of diseases. In \\nan ultra sonography machine, the high frequency ultrasonic waves are produced by electrically stimulating a crystal called a transducer. In an ultra sonography machine, the \\nultrasonic waves are transformed into a narrow beam. Next this beam is directed toward \\nthe organ whose image is to be recorded.  \\nThe beam is reflected, absorbed or transmitted by \\nthe organ toward which they are directed, \\ndepending on the nature of the surface they strike. \\nAs the beam strikes an interface or boundary \\nbetween tissues of varying density (e.g., muscle \\nand blood) part of the sound waves are reflected back to the transducer as echoes. The echoes are \\nthen converted into electrical impulses that are \\ndisplayed on a monitor presenting a ‘picture’ of the organ or muscle under examination.  \\nThe most important use of ultra sonography is in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. \\nWith this, the fetal size, maturity and normal and abnormal position of fetus can be known. It is a fast, relatively safe, and reliable technique in the field of gynecology. \\nUterine tumors and other pelvic masses can be identified by ultra sonography.  \\nUltra sonogram is used in medical tests of different kinds, such as- gall bladder stone, \\ndefect in the heart and identification of tumo rs. When ultrasound is used for examination \\nof the heart, then it is called echocardiography. Ultra sonography is a safer diagnosing \\nmethod in comparison to X-ray.  Yet, it is to be used for a very limited time. Besides, the transducer should always be kept in movement , so that it does not become static at any \\nposition. \\nCT scan  CT scan stands for Computed Tomography Sca n. In medical science it is the process of \\ncreating image. Tomography is the process of generating a two-dimensional image of a \\nslice or section through a 3-dimensional object. CT scanner is a large machine and uses X-rays. Where X-ray forms a two dimensional image of a three dimensional organ inside \\nthe body, there the image formed by CT scan machine is three dimensional.  \\nThe CT scan machine uses digital geometry processing to generate a three dimensional \\nof the inside of an object. The three dimensional image is made after many 2-Figure: 14.3 Ultrasonography '),\n",

This job is done \\nusing a computer. A CT scanner emits a series of narrow beams through the human body as it moves through an arc. While an X-ray machine sends just one X-ray beam through the body of the patient. As a result, the final picture formed by CT scan is far more distinct and detailed than an X-ray one. The X-ray detector used in a CT scanner can detect hundreds of different levels of density in patient’s body. This data collected by the detector is transmitted to a computer. Computer builds up a three dimensional picture of the part of the body and displays it on the screen.  \\nThree dimensional images of soft tissue, blood carrying veins or arteries, lungs, brain, \\netc. is obtained by CT scan. CT scan is used for detection of cancer in lever, lungs and pancreas. The image obtained by CT scan helps a physician to detect tumor, to determine the size and position of the tumor and how much the tumor infected the adjacent tumor. By the CT scan of head, any type of bleeding inside the brain, swelling of artery and existence of tumor can be detected. Whether there is a problem in the blood circulation is also known by the CT scan. Generally CT scan test is not done in case of pregnant women. If dye is used in CT scan test there is a possibility of allergic reaction. \\n \\nFigure: 14.4 CT Scan \\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \\nMRI is the abbreviated form of the English term ‘Magnetic Resonance Imaging’. In MRI \\nmachine extended image of an organ or place of the body is formed utilizing strong magnetic field and radio wave. MRI machine works depending on the physical and chemical principles of ‘Nuclear Magnetic Resonance’. Using this principle, information about the nature of any molecule can be known. MRI is a painless and safe disease '),\n",

X-ray or any other kind of radiation is not used in this machine. The \\nsignals received from the part of the body which is scanned with MRI are transformed using computers and a very distinct image of that part of the body is formed. Each individual image acts as a slice of the organ of the body. Thus a number of images are formed, which exhibits all the characteristics of that part of the body.  \\n \\nFigure 14.5: MRI machine \\nThe image obtained by MRI can be compared to each individual slice of bread. When \\none slice of the bread is picked up, then the interior part of the bread can be seen along \\nwith the slice. Similarly, each image found by MRI helps to view everything inside the \\nbody. The intensity of the wound is determined using MRI in case of twisting of ankles and back pain. MRI is an extremely valuable test to form an extended image of brain and \\nspinal cord. \\nECG ECG is the abbreviated form of the word electrocardiogram. ECG is a diagnostic \\nprocedure that is routinely used to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the \\nheart. We know that t he heart produces tiny electrical impulses without any external \\nstimulation. This electrical signal spread through the heart muscle to make the heart \\ncontract. We detect these impulses by the ECG machine. With the help of ECG we can \\nmeasure the rate and rhythms of heartbeats. It gives indirect evidence of blood flow in the heart. \\nThe electrodes placed on the different parts of the body detect the electrical impulses \\ncoming from different directions within the heart. To get a complete picture of the heart, twelve signals are identified using ten electrodes. An electrode lead is placed on each \\narm and leg i.e. total of four and rest six electrodes are placed across the chest wall \\n[Figure 14.6]. The signals received from each electrode are recorded. The printed view \\nof these recordings is the electro gram.  '),\n",

If any type of abnormal condition is observed in the heart of a person, then the \\npatterns from the electrodes will be different from that of a normal pattern.  \\nGenerally, ECG test is done to find the cause of external symptoms such as- palpitations, \\nirregular and fast heart beat, chest pain etc. of some diseases. Sometimes it is done as a \\npart of routine tests- for example, before you have an operation you can take the help of \\nECG.  \\nThe heart disorders that can be detected by ECG are: \\n1. Abnormal heart rhythms- for example, if the heart is very fast, very slow or \\nirregular. \\n2. A heart attack- which happened recent or some time ago. \\n3. An enlarged heart- i.e. the size of the heart is increased. \\nEndoscopy  Generally endoscopy means looking inside something. But by endoscopy we mean \\nlooking interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body for medical reasons using an \\nendoscope machine. We examine the interior side of hollow organs of our body using endoscope machine. \\n \\nFigure: 14.7 Endoscopy \\nIn an endoscope machine, there are two tubes. Through one of them light is transferred to a definite organ of patient’s body from outside. Due to the total internal reflection of light on the inner wall of the optical fiber, bright light enters the body cavity of patient.  '),\n",

The reflected part of light returns \\nback through the second fiber optic tube in the same way. The reflected light enters the \\neyes of doctors through the eyepiece lens. As a result, the doctor can see what is \\nhappening inside the examined organ.  \\nEndoscopy allows doctors to check for any type of irritation, ulcer, inflammation and \\nabnormal tissue growth in the internal organ. Endoscopy is used to examine a number of \\ndifferent organs, including: \\n(A)  the lungs, central partition of the chest; (B) the stomach, small intestine, large \\nintestine or colon; (C) the female reproductive organ; (D) the abdomen and pelvis; (E) \\nthe inside of urinary bladder; (F) the nasal cavity and sinuses surrounding the nose; (G) the ears. \\nRadiotherapy  \\nThe word radiotherapy is the abbreviated form of the word ‘Radiation therapy’. \\nDifferent diseases like cancer, abnormal nature of thyroid gland, some diseases \\nconcerning blood are treated using it. Generally radiotherapy destroys cancer cells \\nutilizing highly energized X-ray. It destroys the power of multiplication of the cells by damaging the DNA inside the tumor cell. Main ly, it is the application of ionizing \\n(radioactive) radiation in the treatment of disease.  \\nRadiotherapy is of two types:  1. External beam radiation or external radiotherapy \\n2. Internal radiotherapy \\nIn case of  external radiotherapy highly energized X-ray, cobalt radiation, electron or \\nproton beams are applied from outside the body. The beam is applied directing to that \\nsite of the body where the tumor is located. As a result, the growth and power of \\nmultiplication of the cancer cells get destroyed. In this process a very few number of healthy cells also get affected. Yet, our aim is to destroy cancer cells as many as possible \\nthan the healthy cells. Most of the healthy cells that got damaged can repair themselves. \\n \\nFigure 14.8: Radiotherapy machine \\nIn case of internal radiotherapy, radiotherapy is applied from inside the body of a \\npatient.

This process is called brachytherapy.    \\nETT  \\nETT is the short form of ‘Exercise Tolerance Test’. It is a test of the stimulated heart. \\nElectric activities or functions (rate or rhythm) of the heart during exercise are recorded \\nby ETT. In fact, it is an ECG test of the patient while doing exercise. This test is very \\nimportant for identifying the diseases related to coronary artery. During this test, extra stress of exercise is imposed on the heart.  \\n \\nFigure 14.9: ETT test \\nPartial blockage developed in the coronary arteries of heart is identified by this test. \\nGenerally, this type of abnormal condition in patient’s body cannot be identified while \\ntaking rest.  \\nDuring the test, the patient is instructed to ride a stationary bicycle or to walk \\ncontinuously on a treadmill machine. The physician records the ECG of the patient \\nduring exercise. By adjusting the speed of rotation of the wheel and slope of the surface, the degree of stress is gradually increase d. Physicians become able to identify the \\nchanges that occur in the patient’s heart during exercise through ETT.  \\nAngiography  Angiography is such an imaging test where X-ray is used to view the blood vessels of \\nthe body. This test is used to study whether the arteries or veins are narrow, blocked or \\nenlarged in the body. The normal flow of blood is obstructed in the body when the blood vessels are blocked and they are narrow or not wide. During angiogram the physicians \\ninject a liquid through a thin and flexible tube into the patient’s body. The liquid is \\ncalled ‘dye’ and the tube is called ‘catheter’. The blood vessels become visible on an X-ray due to the use of dye. This dye is later eliminated from the body through kidneys and \\nurine. Through a definite entry point the catheter is introduced into a definite artery or \\nvein. The entry point may be in any blood vessel of the body. Sometimes, the ‘dye’ used is also termed as ‘contrast’.  '),\n",

The mechanism or the procedure following which the blocked \\narteries are cleared during an angiogram is called angioplasty. \\nIsotopes and its uses \\nIsotopes are the variants of a definite el ement. Atoms of the same element having \\ndifferent mass number are called isotopes. That is, in isotopes of an element, the number \\nof protons is same but the number of neutr on is different. The number of protons in the \\nnucleus of atom of an element identifies the element uniquely. But in principle, an \\nelement may have any number of neutrons. The total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an element is its mass number. For this reason, each isotope of \\nan element has different mass number. Carbon can be considered as an example. Three \\nisotopes of carbon\\n12\\n6C, 13\\n6C and14\\n6C- the mass number of them are 12, 13, 14 \\nrespectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, i.e. there are six protons in each carbon \\natom. As a result, the number of neutrons in the isotopes of carbon is 6, 7 and 8 \\nrespectively.  \\nIn the field of medical science, radioactive isotopes are widely used in nuclear medicine. \\nRadioisotopes have two types of applications.  \\nA. For diagnosis purpose  \\nB. For treatment purpose \\nThe presence of harmful cancer tumor anywhere in the body or in an organ can be \\nidentified by radioisotopes. The energetic gamma rays emitted from the isotope Co-60 is \\nused for the treatment of cancer. The gamma rays emitted from Co-60 is used to sterilize \\nsurgical instruments.

      "the book is between 25.9cm and 26.1cm. Here 0.1cm is the uncertainty or error of measurement.  \n",
      "Generally there are three types of error in measurement. There are :  a) Random error  \n",
      "b) Instrumental error   c) Personal error  a) Random error : The error for which irrelevant occur in measured results by \n",
      "measuring a constant quantities. Several times is random error. The word random itself \n",
      "implies that the error cannot be guessed earlier and expected value will be zero. This is because measured values moves around the accurate value and average value of the \n",
      "errors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. \n",
      "The random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the \n",
      "accurate mark. Another random error takes place with the measurement when the meter \n",
      "scale is placed at the previous marking (sli ghtly error position) as back edge starts from \n",
      "back and forth position. The final result may be very much high or low due to random \n",
      "error. It is impossible to avoid random error but this error can be reduced by \n",
      "precautionary measurement. In order to minimize the random error average of the frequent measurement is to be taken.  \n",
      "b) Instrumental error : We need instruments for experimental measurement in physics. \n",
      "The error with the instrument is called instrumental error. For example, if the zero \n",

      "an experimenter makes during experiment is called personal error. The error with the \n",
      "position of the observer, observing any mark or any calculation is also said to be \n",
